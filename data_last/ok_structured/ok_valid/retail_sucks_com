very

once

what

are

they

tattoos
they

poor

they

they
are
overweight

thin
missing

half
unshaven
otherwise

they
look

they

long

they
are
often
young
middle

very
rare
see
someone
years

foodstamps
they
buy
extremely
unhealthy
packaged
food
that
people
who
make
their
own
money
would
not
buy
such
large
quantities
example
shopping
cart
full
little
debbies
potato
chips
bakery
goods
and
hamburger
helper
they
often
seem
lack
any
gratitude
for
the
fact
that
they
are
receiving
their
food
for
free
often
have
negative
vibe
about
themi
would
say
the

not
all

exhibit
some

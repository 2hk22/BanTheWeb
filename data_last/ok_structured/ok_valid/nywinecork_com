remembering
dick
reno
february
received
call
from
our
good
friend
winemaker
tim
miller
dick
reno
had
passed
met
dick
and
betty
mrs
reno
had
wandered
into
chateau
lafayette
reneau
winery
the
day
cabernet
reserve
club
members
event
betty
had
done
the
cooking
and
was
making
sure
that
everyone
had
something
eat
weren
members
but
she
insisted
that
take
share
every
visit
afterward
betty
always
made
sure
that
had
something
eat
jar
jelly
some
tomatoes
some
garden
seeds
bring
home
dick
visited
with
every
guest
made
feel
particularly
welcome
like
was
our
tenth
visit
even
though
was
our
first
dick
and
betty
reno
were
warm
and
generous
hosts
that
visit
was
part
our
research
into
starting
unique
new
business
commerce
store
that
carried
only
new
york
grown
wines
launched
our
business
may
and
since
then
have
paid
over
visits
the
finger
lakes
more
than
half
our
visits
included
stop
see
dick
and
betty
learned
from
dick
about
his
early
dream
converting
overgrown
jelly
grape
farm
into
vineyard
and
winery
that
produced
wines
par
with
bordeaux
the
day
his
dry
riesling
won
the
governor
cup
were
helping
dick
serve
wine
the
new
york
wine
and
food
classic
was
chateau
lafayette
second
governor
cup
dick
diligence
about
quality
and
focus
operations
had
made
his
world
class
dream
reality
dick
welcomed
into
his
winery
and
allowed
study
the
entire
operation
from
vineyards
through
bottling
and
sales
learned
most
what
know
about
winemaking
from
our
visits
with
dick
and
with
tim
miller
they
showed
every
detail
the
chateau
lafayette
reneau
facility
dick
was
accomplished
businessman
well
before
and
betty
established
their
winery
every
visit
dick
would
ask
about
our
new
business
and
then
advise
only
sell
the
best
always
ask
for
the
sale
believe
your
product
discuss
act
report
dick
took
fatherly
interest
our
progress
and
like
teenagers
took
some
his
advice
with
fatherly
insight
dick
could
tell
which
advice
were
following
and
which
advice
had
overlooked
our
relationship
with
dick
betty
and
tim
has
outlasted
our
own
business
they
are
our
extended
family
and
tuesday
felt
like
had
lost
parent
dick
salute
you
determined
dreamer
diligent
businessman
generous
host
fatherly
advisor
and
true
gentleman
have
been
honored
your
friend

all
these
years

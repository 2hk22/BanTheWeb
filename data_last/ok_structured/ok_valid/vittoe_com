some
travel
tips

our
travel
philosophy
tips
for
driving
europe
one
bothersome
thing
about
all
the
information
the
internet
the
accuracy
have
found
that
people
can
travel
and
have
really
great
time
place
and
another
couple
can
the
same
place
and
not
enjoy
all
take
anything
say
with
grain
salt
the
place
may
have
been
excellent
for
and
not
good
for
you
generally
don
say
many
bad
things
about
specific
place
have
time
just
don
back
too
many
people
have
bad
experience
and
then
write
bad
post
review
get
even
sometimes
think
the
bad
experience
their
own
fault
one
time
saw
hotel
owner
spend
almost
hour
trying
get
single
woman
room
another
town
where
there
was
festival
then
the
next
day
the
woman
was
waiting
front
the
hotel
for
man
who
she
had
paid
take
her
luggage
the
train
station
the
man
never
showed
the
hotel
owner
told
one
his
employees
carry
her
bags
the
train
station
talked
her
the
train
station
and
she
couldn
say
enough
bad
things
about
the
hotel
owner
figure
another
thing
hate
the
search
engines
you
search
for
hotel
city
and
the
first
finds
are
from
companies
that
have
relationship
your
search
they
are
automatically
generated
pages
that
try
sell
you
something
some
the
called
travel
help
sites
are
just
trying
harvest
your
email
some
others
allow
people
post
anonymous
reviews
which
are
just
places
for
people
flame
establishment
good
example
this
tripadvisor
where
they
accept
anonymous
reviews
come
you
write
review
sign
don
have
lot
recommended
places
these
pages
sometimes
tell
where
stay
and
what
did
what
happened
and
never
want
your
email
really
like
place
may
say
nice
things
about

the
word
charity
means
different
things
different
people
and
word
often
bandied
around
conversation
the
definition
charity
the
act
giving
without
expecting
anything
return
but
this
innocent
meaning
seems
have
got
lost
translation
somewhere
down
the
line
with
many
charities
now
having
offer
gifts
return
for
donation
taking
down
altogether
different
route
the
fact
that
there
are
currently
thousands
charities
throughout
the
who
rely
public
donations
carry
out
whole
host
good
deeds
behind
the
scenes
that
many
are
not
even
aware
many
these
non
profit
organisations
perform
crucial
roles
society
helping
out
the
sick
the
homeless
the
vulnerable
both
man
and
beast
and
today
society
they
are
more
needed
than
ever
these
are
undoubtedly
tough
times
for
charities
and
the
news
that
the
few
who
receive
government
funding
are
going
have
their
funding
slashed
even
worse
news
for
all
concerned
especially
those
who
run
and
manage
charities
there
have
been
various
reasons
given
for
these
cuts
but
they
are
scant
relief
those
who
now
have
try
and
carry
out
the
same
standard
help
before
but
vastly
reduced
budget
the
worst
case
scenario
that
they
have
cease
functioning
altogether
meaning
that
all
those
they
previously
helped
have
either
without
find
someone
else
help
them
out
charities
are
now
being
forced
having
cut
costs
whilst
working
increase
their
profile
bring
more
donations
cover
their
funding
cuts
altogether
bleak
outlook
for
charities
the
moment
one
the
most
vital
works
that
charities
carry
out
medical
research
and
some
believe
that
those
involved
this
branch
are
some
the
most
important
then
again
what
price
can
you
put
the
life
child
who
suffering
neglect
torment
then
there
are
the
animal
charities
and
small
local
charities
whose
work
done
quietly
and
without
fuss
but
produce
great
results
donating
charity
should
for
the
right
reasons
and
many
set
monthly
payment
plan
charity
particularly
close
their
hearts
other
deposit
their
loose
change
into
charity
boxes
and
others
down
the
sponsorship
route
doesn
matter
how
much
you
give
you
charity
what
way
you
give
every
little
helps
there
are
many
who
give
their
time
selfless
volunteers
who
put
hours
charity
shops
etc
and
contribution
valuable
cash
without
them
these
shops
couldn
function
there
are
many
who
don
make
regular
donations
and
instead
wait
for
events
such
children
need
and
red
nose
day
roll
around
before
making
donation
while
these
causes
are
obviously
worthy
please
try
not
forget
your
local
charities
and
help
them
out
any
way
that
you
can

has
the
talent
the
league
games
against
reggie
jackson
and
palmer

exciting
mullen
two
final
fours
and
state
championship
are
things
that
programs
often
dream
about
for
coach
cutrell
and
the
mustangs
that
the
level
expectations
that
they
must
live
cutrell
has
built
mullen
into
perennial
powerhouse
and
with
stars
terrance

don
see
mullen
falling
short
those
expectations
cherry

and
this

exception
trey
eckloff

boulder
will
have
enough
support
from
his
fellow
bruins
palmer
this
team
could
catapult
these
rankings
very
soon
reggie
jackson
has
very
capable
cast
around
him
and
should
they
split
with
doherty
like
them
come
tourny
time

will
the

finally
live
their
potential
wheat

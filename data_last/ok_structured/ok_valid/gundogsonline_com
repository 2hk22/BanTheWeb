reviewselectronic
dog
training
collar
reviewsmore
than
years
ago
electronic
collars
made
their
way
into
the
dog
training
scene
however
because
the
first
generation
electronic
collars
were
only
capable
delivering
one
level
stimulation
the
dog
they
where
appropriately
nicknamed
shock
collars
these
collars
required
the
trainer
select
the
level
correction
inserting
intensity
plug
into
the
collar
before
putting
the
collar
the
dog
for
training
once
the
collar
was
the
dog
they
could
not
change
the
intensity
level
this
plug
would
then
cause
the
collar
emit
the
same
level
stimulation
for
all
corrections
issued
during
the
session
regardless
how
small
large
the
infraction

the
nickname

standing

outside
lucky
market
saturday
jon
rosen
had
idea
how
was
going
carry
pounds
potatoes
across
town
had
packaged
ham
and
frozen
pie
schlep
well
along
with
ounces
apple
sauce
and
few
other
groceries
then
banks
pulled
and
parked
his
two
wheeler
with
trailer
tow
throwing
rosen
wave
and
pulling
out
his
shopping
list
now
that
the

cyclists
rode
the

combine
some

with
the

holiday
seinfeld
lore
festivus
saturday
sending
some
intrepid
riders
local
grocery
stores
purchase
holiday
meals
for
clients
the
central
pantry
this
the
first
time
someone
has
strapped
ham
their
body
and
rode
through
columbia

event
director
beth
shepard
said
she
got
the
idea
from
cranksgiving
food
drives
around
the
country
just
that
the
date
she
chose
was
little
too
late
for
thanksgiving
themed
event
festivus
she
said
good
wholesome
nondenominational
fun
aside
from
the
airing
grievances
another
aspect
the
fictional
seinfeld
holiday
adventure
shepard
said
that
one
way
describe
ross
said
really
open
anything
said
thought
was
crazy
idea
but
did
crazy
things
when
was
younger
too
cyclists
are
the
kind
community
that
likes
those
sorts
excursions
said
misty
brawner
vice
president
the
columbia
multisport
club
and
provider
technical
support
during
the
race
the
rider
who
returned
the
fastest

five
stops
lucky
schnucks
forum
boulevard
and
walmart
gerbes
and
hyvee
west
broadway
won
small
prize
did
the
rider
who
brought
back
the
most
food
and
went
beyond
the
required
list
cyclists
are
pretty
unique
brand
said
brawner
they
want
get
out
and
ride
you
give
them
reason
and
they
out
for
and
reason
ride
the
winter
even
more
compelling
she
said
that
spirit
lends
itself
funky
camaraderie
between
fellow
cyclists
who
can
appreciate
long
ride
race
the
spring
without
the
benefit
winter
ride
she
said
weird
sense
competition
but

arrived
electricity

but
did
reading
this
and
knew
expect
that
this
could
happen
and
knew
the
answer
was
have
cocktail
however
along
with
electricity
means
ice
means
warm
cocktails
first
thought
you
have
got
kidding
just
left

met

there
she
was
there
for

already
staying

for
the
yoga

and
then
clicked
what

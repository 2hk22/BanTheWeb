for

last
august
were
excited
stay
somewhere
that
was
remote
full
natural
beauty
and
off
the
grid
arrived
night
despite
tom
missy
recommendations
arrive
during
the
day
but
didn
have
too
much
trouble
finding
the
property
was
clean
arrival
and
looked
very
nice
the
various
literature
provided
tom
and
missy
the
cottage
was
more
than
adequate
understand
how
use
everything
the
cottage
which
sites
were
nearby
and
also
how
identify
the
various
plants
and
trees
the
property
the
next
day
woke
beautiful
sunshine
flowing
through
the
windows
and
motivation
explore
think
each
time
went
outside
explore
throughout
our
stay
would
discover
some
new
tree
plant
that
had
previously
not
seen
the
sun
was
very
bright
the
morning
but
sometimes
got
little
hazy
the
afternoon
due
the
volcanic
fog
however
this
was
not
really
problem
for
reality
was
benefit
this
meant
the
volcano
was
not
too
far
away
for
visit
hawaii
beautiful
green
sand
beach
would
often
drive
west
around
the
coast
black
sand
beach
not
far
way
relax
and
have
picnic
even
had
chance
visit
the
green
sand
beach
the
only
one
that
know
which
was
also
not
too
far
from

showed
full
power
throughout
our
stay
guess
the
sun
was
bright
for
long
enough
handle
and
didn
even
have
power
problems
when
using
the
washer
and
dryer
all
worked
great
must
say
that
was
very
nice
being
able
pick
fresh
fruit
from
the
trees
the
yard
including
limes
for
our
drinks
made
feel
very
much
touch
with

the
italian
who
effortlessly
guided
his
volley
past
tremmel
salzburg
offered
little
attack
and
the
visitors
were
reduced
speculative
pot
shots
for
the
majority
the
opening
half
which
barely
troubled

given
who
had
been

for

chipped
pass
from

the

raced
through

showed
natural
strength
brushing
off

but
got
closer
goal
the
italian
went
without
any
hint
challenge
bid
win
penalty
the
referee

conned
and
balotelli
spurned
the
opportunity
grab
brace
before
the

barely
had
move
out

gear
and
the
tenacity
james

combined
with
the
vision

execution
vieira
passing

given
the
opportunity
shine
and
whilst

spells
the

not

pace
his
crossing
was
erratic

contrast
adam

had
little
the
ball
but
his
delivery
was
consistently
accurate
the
last
chance
the
half
fell
milner
the

showed
rare
burst
pace
and
raced
through
goal

screwed

shot

wide

immediately
wright
phillips
who
had
switched
flanks
with
johnson
burst
down
the
left
but
once
again
his
final
ball
was
disappointing
the
england
international
failed
pick
out
balotelli
with
his
cutback
continued
become
one
way
traffic
and
even
the
visitors
struggled
take
control
the
game
with
man
advantage
after

slipped
off
the
pitch
for
few
minutes
the
pressure
finally
amounted
city
doubling

advantage
after

slipped
vieira
whose
scuffed
shot
fell
nicely
into
the
path
balotelli

muted

with

the
irish

was
match
the
effort
and

ball
around
the

snowy
stroll
the

thirteen
minutes
from
time
exquisite
fashion
after

from

north

falconry
and
the
art
hunting
with
birds
prey
can
traced
back
china
and
mesopotamia
when
europe
was
invaded
huns
and
asians
around
they
brought
the
practice
with
them
europe
became
sport
adopted
kings
and
nobles
and
was
considered
status
symbol
reality
the
time
and
cost
keeping
and
training
such
birds
was
beyond
the
means
all
but
the
privileged
few
the
position
king
falconer
commanded
high
status
the
knowledge
experience
and
skills
top

widely
recognised
and

the
web
life
birds
prey
can
divided
two
distinct
types
broad
wing
and
narrow
wing
most
british
birds
prey
such
owls
buzzards
hawks
and
eagles
have
relatively
broad
wings
that
are
ideal
for
soaring
and
hovering
and
the
case
owls
for
achieving
completely
silent
flight
falcons
are
narrow
winged
their
wings
are
also
swept
back
and
designed
for
speed
peregrine
falcons
have
been
measured
diving
over
miles
per
hour
which
makes
them
the
fastest
creatures
earth
the

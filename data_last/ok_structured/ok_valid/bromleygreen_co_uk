the

for

who
produced
some
excellent
football
and
matched
their
faversham
charity

opponents

semi
final
charing

capitalised
two
early
errors
while
the
green
just
could
not
convert
number
chances
despite
being
two
goals
down
the
break
the
tie
was
far
from
over
but
perhaps
our
fortunes
were
epitomised
the
denial
blatant
penalty
scoreline
flattered
the
canterbury
side
but
wish
them
well
the
final

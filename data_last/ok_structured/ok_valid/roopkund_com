planning
for
the

project
was
interesting
and
intense
part
many
our
indiahikes
meetings
the
motivating
force
that
resulted
this
initiative
was
deep
concern
that
the
very
mountains
that
inspire
thousands
would
soon
become
reflection
the
pathetic
disregard
most
humans
have
for
nature
and
its
bounties
most
the
regular
trekking
trails
have
become
eyesore
and
more
and
more
trekkers
are
returning
with
water
borne
diseases
unheard
the
past
this
means
our
water
sources
are
getting
polluted
their
source
the
mountains
give
much
and
its
time
did
something
for
the
mountains

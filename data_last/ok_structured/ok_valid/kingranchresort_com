living

ideal
having
fun
and
learning
about
nature
when
was
younger
remember
going
out
the
country
and
admiring
the
horses
the
chickens
and
yes
even
the
pigs
you
wonder
the
farm
animals
have
feelings
their
brain
work
the
same
way
mine
this
the
type
tumbler
bought
grandkids
spent
countless
hours
thinking
about
this
and
many
more
hours
collecting
rocks
would
find
the
most
beautiful
rocks
polish
them
and
put
them
shelf
room
they
were
more
than
rocks
they
were
valuable
assets
now
look
back
childhood
can
see
how
important
stay
touch
with
your
surroundings
invest
the
future
your
grandkids
this
what
prompted
buy
grandkids
their
first
rock
tumbler
kit
rock
tumbler
kits
for
kids
are
fun
easy
use
and
very
inspirational
too
many
kids
are
not
interested
geography
science
and
this
shame
believe
that
continue
talk
grandkids
and
share
personal
experiences
with
them
they
will
eventually
want
learn
more
about
the
world
they
live
the

complete
with
everything
grandkids
need
make
their

priceless

removed
making
the

even
more
appealing
than
before
there
are
several
rock
tumbler
kits
for
kids
choose
from
chose
the
ones
that
are
age
appropriate
because
grandkids
range
ages
from
younger
children
can
understand
the
instructions
contained
the
advanced
kits
and
the
older
kids
may
find
insulting
give
them
kit
that
obviously
meant
for
year
old
feel
good
about
your
choice
after
watching
grandkids
collect
their
rocks
polish
them
and
make
them
pretty
and
all
realized
made
the
right

where
the

the

gather
fresh

are
days
when
asked
prepare
lunch
dinner
for
large
number
people
instead
just
feeding
the
family
might
fixing
meals
for
several
dozen
individuals
not
long
ago
was
the
type
person
who
would
just
toss
package
into
the
microwave
and
consider
that
cooking
was
when
first
moved
our
ranch
that
discovered
that
was
much
more
fun
create
meals
from
scratch
course
kitchen
adventures
began
out
sheer
necessity
needed
save
money
and
trim
expenses
once
purchased
our
small
ranch
became
obvious
that
could
seriously
cut
costs
making
homemade
jams
and
preserves
baking
bread
and
canning
foods
home
instead
using
expensive
packaged
food
products
learned
how
make
pasta
and
how
use
leftovers
stews
soups
and
casseroles
discovered
that
garden
bounty
onions
greens
beans
carrots
and
tomatoes
were
cheaper
and
more
tastier
than
purchasing
the
same
items
the
store
our
ranch
located
almost
hour
drive
from
the
nearest
town
which
also
means
that
more

traveling
back
and
forth
for
take
out
food
have
become
fairly
expert
making
pizzas
yeast
rolls
pies
and
tasty
casseroles
think
that
our
bbq
hamburgers
and
grilled
steaks
are
wonderful
these
foods
are
flavored
perfection
and
then
prepared
outdoors
what
could
possibly
better
than
freshly
cooked
food
being
eaten
beneath
canopy

usually
give
the

one
relatively

overcooked

the
pcc

the
bod
meeting
chicago
was
amazing
experience
say
this
even
though
cynical
experienced
veteran
usfa
committee
work
and
political
posturing
expectation
was
that
although
was
new
and
possibly
better
group
that
lot
the
same
issues
lack
collaboration
and
compromise
would
limit
the
groups
ability
get
things
done
thank
goodness
was
wrong
the
meeting
agenda
was
clear
the
leadership
positive
and
appropriate
the
information
clear
and
available
accomplished
all
that
hoped
time
you
can
see
the
minutes
called
draft
because
they
need
ratified
the
next
meeting
that
there
were
number
actions

problems
redefine
the
role
the
organization
and

strong
differences
opinions

knee
injuries
female
athletes
posted
september
flechewounds
the
last
couple
weeks
unfortunately
had
opportunity
learn
lot
about
the
knee
injuries
female
athletes
primarily
because
daughter
had
bit
scare
which
thankfully
turned
out
minor
turns
out
that
female
athletes
have
inordinate
number
knee
injuries
while
there
some
debate
about
the
underlying
reasons
some
think
has
with
hip
geometry
post
adolescent
female
athletes
others
think
that
its
the
lack
weight
training
that
girls
after
puberty
the
answer
does
seem
indicate
more
stringent
physical
training
for
these
competitors
attached
some
research
and
information
from
the
university
cincinnati
that
was
sent
encourage
all
female
athletes
and
their
parents
coaches
read
and
any
other
information
that
they
can
get
their
hands
then
encourage
our
women
fencers
those
who
are
responsible
for
our
women
fencers
speak
with
their
doctors
and
coaches
and
develop
training
plan
improve
strength
around
these
very
important
joints
can
encourage
these
athletes
the
training
necessary
reduce
the
incidence
these
injuries
and
prolong
their
enjoyment

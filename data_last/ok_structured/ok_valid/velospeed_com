may
tour
somerville
maybe
next
year
yesterday
was
first
crack
racing
the
pro
category
the
tour
somerville
haven
raced
this
classic
america
oldest
bike
race
since
was
excited
return
the
smaller
crowds
were
bit
disappointing
but
guess
that
what
years
doping
scandals
will
sport
still
there
were
plenty
people
out
there
cheering
for
including
good
friend
steve
and
his
darling
bride
holly
congrats
surprisingly
had
good
legs
yesterday
and
was
able
stay
the
front
for
most
the
race
snuck
off
the
front
occasionally
with
small
groups
that
accelerated
but
never
anything
the
home
straight
where
plug
from
rich
fries
might
actually
make
worth
anything
there
were
fair
number
mishaps
and
unfortunately
one
them
came
the
worst
time
and
place
just
few
riders
front
approached
one
lap
miraculously
made
around
the
rider
front
who
launched
over
his
bars
but
rode
over
some
dude
leg
and
then
shoulder
clipped
the
guy
that
had
been
front
was
suddenly
next
the
air
spun
like
helicopter
skidded
halt
straddling
the
top
tube
with
both
cleats
digging
into
the
road
still
can
believe
nobody
plowed
into
seeing
was
the
top
huge
field
this
point
and
least
more
guys
plowed
into
the
dude
whose
leg
ran
over
and
that
how
ended
from
the
front
the
back
matter
seconds

surprise
every

that
next

train
harder
doesn
hurt
much
last
year
torn
hip
cartilage
and
running
the
weeks
before
the
marathon
translated
into
slow
painful
run
that
nasty
storm
this
year
january
hip
surgery
followed
weeks
off
and
mere
mile
long
run
translated
into
very
low
expectations
and
while
yesterday
heat
was
brutal
the
hip
surgery
was
clearly
success
ran
pain
free
the
whole
miles
was
shooting
for
but
truly
felt
like
anything
sub
would

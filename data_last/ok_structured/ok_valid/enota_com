seemed
too
good
true
mountain
campground
with
cabins
working
farm
nearby
waterfalls
for
hiking
and
the
list
goes
the
most
intriguing
part

found
more
than
what
expected

get
out

just
wanted
let
the

experience
the
fun
being
all
piled
with
your

sleeping
the
fresh
air
and
listening
the

was
very
neat

see
this
done
first
hand
was
somewhat
educational
experience
for
them
myself
and
family
was
great
attraction
because
the
land
was
kept
natural
and
clean
and
being
able

setting
was
very
peaceful

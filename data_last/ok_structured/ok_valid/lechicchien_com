this
morning
there
rose
such
clatter
seems
all
the
giants
bark
loud
what
the
matter
stumble
and
grumble
daze
down
the
hall
the
morning
bounce
the
wall
sleepy
and
tired
but
must
move
quick
the
neighbors
know
damn
well
this
noise
ain
nick
out
through
the
back
door
the
cold
airs
blast
arms
sprouting
goosebumps
hands
feet
and
ass
when
suprise
the
barking
does
cease
notice
some
red
pants
they
not
one
piece
black
boot
lay
mangled
the
thought
does
occur
that
old
dog
toy
some
kind
fur

chill
the
night
the
glint
the
snow
swear
hear
sleighbells
but
don
really
know
wife

through
all
this
did
not
arouse
her
then
someone
starts
yelling
those
damn
giant
schnauzers
look
the
sky
and
what
see
angry
old
fat
man
pointing
the
scene
look
strange
what
with
this
old
coot
roof
with

and
one

you
some
presents
starts

but
those
crazy
guard

must
insane
talk
all
animals
but
these
they
don
care
slid
down
the
chimney
tried
fair
the
black
ones
they
warned
they
barked
meaning
halt
but
what
the
hells
wrong
with
those
pepper
and
salts
they
didn
say
one
thing
and
they
didn
wait
popped
out
the
chimney
and
fell
for
the
bait
then
santa
stared
his
face
got
all
red
pointed
rico
and
here
what
said
that
one

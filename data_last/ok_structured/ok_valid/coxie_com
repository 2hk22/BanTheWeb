this

long
time
ago
the
initial
one
had
few
problems
and
sure
this
one
does
too
however
hope
fix
bit
and
views
have
also
changed
progressed
cox
answers
will
have
changed
bit
too
again
all
this
own
opinion
the
point
compare
and
learn
from
different
perspectives
enjoy
why
you
personally
cox
have
you
tried
rowing
used
hate
coxing
had
never
been
consistently
wrong
anything
ever
was
discouraging
eventually
asked
around
for
bit
help
and
found
this
site
been
improving
ever
since
initially
motivation
was
get
better
and
try
impress
this
new
community
was
especially
being
the
youngest
and
most
inexperienced
the
club
now
simply
love
coxing
and
the
sport
itself
that
motivation
get
better
have
tried
rowing
and
still
row
small
and
weak
surprise
surprise
but
motivation
that
the
other
cox
very
petite
the
club
also
rower
she
grade
rower
possible
would
like
very
experienced
cox
and
competent
rower
what
coxswain
very
important
part
any
crew
with
the
exception
the
unmentionable
coxless
goers
shocked
whose
main
priority
make
the
boat
able
the
fastest
possibly
can
the
cox
motivates
delegates
and
steers
the
boat
are
you
only
important
the
water
does
your
importance
and
status
remain
land
too
you
think
there
any
benefit
from
crew
chats
believe
your
importance
remains
land
too
unless
the
pub
when
the
rowers
take
over
stuff
like
boat
loading
regattas
rigging
land
training
getting
the
boat
the
water
and
back
you
have
make
sure
that
you
know
what
going
and
the
rowers
know
you
are
charge
even
stroke
calling
the
shots
you
have
the
power
change
what
says
not
that
you
but
you
have
make
them
think
that
obviously
crew
chats
before
and
after
are
very
important
part
hate
when
people
walk
away
without
crew
chat
want
give
feedback
and
want
myself
the
best
way
learn
what
the
rowers
felt
the
coach
felt
and
what
you
personally
felt
gives
the
strength
the
crew

together
mentally
and
physically

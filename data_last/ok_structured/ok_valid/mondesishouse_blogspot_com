mondesi
house
going
hiatus
dear
readers
with
very
heavy
heart
that
write
this
but
effective
immediately
mondesi
house
will
going
indefinite
hiatus
know
many
longtime
readers
have
noticed
that
have
not
been
posting
with
the
same
frequency
the
same
enthusiasm
had
the
past
and
coincidence
the
truth
that
have
member
family
who
has
been
battling
illness
for
quite
some
time
and
needs
assistance
and
care
now
more
than
ever
with
that
constant
storyline
life
addition
the
stress
operating
business
full
time
hope
you
can
understand
where
coming
from
will
not
able
post
right
now
and
not
sure
when
exactly
will
return
know
that
want
continue
operating
the
site
the
future
have
put
nearly
five
years
life
into
building
unfortunately
simply
did
not
have
the
available
time
energy
continue
level
was
satisfied
with
and
that
will
certainly
not
change
very
soon
want
thank
each
and
every
one
you
for
your
support
over
the
years
which
really
meant
the
world
its
peak
like
think
the
site
was
something
that
brought
lot
entertainment
and
information
people
know
hasn
been
the
same
for
quite
some
time
now
and
doubt
will
ever
get
back
the
level
once
was
but
can
say
that
love
write
and
love
the
city
pittsburgh
and
our
sports
teams
once
feel
can
produce
something
proud
again
will
return
don
know
when
that
will
but
will
happen
the
meantime
available
through
email
and
twitter
and
when
the
day
arrives
that
come
back
you
can
rest
assured
that
will
put
the
word
out
but
for
now
just
keep
family
your
thoughts
and
prayers
and
that
will
mean
more
than
you
would
ever
imagine
sincerely

field
trip
oilers
penguins
live
and
site
this
afternoon
the
consol
energy
center
for
today
pens
oilers
matchup
and
have
the
distinct
nature
being
the
next
last
person
pick
their
media
pass
being
bested
only
the
great
michel
therrien
let
just
say
describing
pace
slow
motion
today
would
insult
the
joggin
george
hendricks
the
world
although
must
say
timed
trip
perfectly
coincide
with
every
red
light
the
sometimes
depressing
well
arriving
the
same
time
the
pens
fans
who
were
likewise
running
behind
their
schedule
nothing
notable
has
happened
the
game
yet
let
delve
little
more
into
trip
today
sensing
would
too
late
for
the
cec
pregame
meal
stopped
sheetz
for
mto
burrito
and
gallon
diet
pepsi
bad
idea
although
could
inspiration
for
future
installment
nerd
food
which
has
been
somewhat
hiatus
continued
down
the
aforementioned
and
the
further
went
the
more
mood
turned
sad
you
not
from
the
pittsburgh
area
let
describe
stretch
the
road
the
area
baldwin
brentwood
basically
goes
abandoned
building
abandoned
building
pawn
shop
abandoned
building
pawn
shop
abandoned
building
probably
not
the
poster
child
for
the
economic
renaissance
pittsburgh
and
top
off
just
before
got
the
tunnel
there
was
young
girl
the
side
road
with
sign
that
said
stranded
broke
hungry
and
she
had
her
dog
with
her
yeah
this
pretty
much
killed
buzz
going
today
game
riding
that
wave
passed
the
parking
spot
across
the
street
from
the
cec
search
better
lot
never
paid
park
for
penguin
game
unwisely
told
myself
luckily
had
very
pedestrian
friendly
batch
pittsburgh
police
working
the
traffic
lights
got
waste
minutes
traffic
before
finding
spot
for
easily
one
the
worst
examples
cheapness
exhibited
years
the
planet
follow
that
with
entering
the
wrong
gate
and
getting
two
cec
employees
who
didn
know
where
the
media
entrance
was
and
voila
the
recipe
for
arrival
game
has
been
written
but
least
got
see
the
national
anthem
suppose
should
write
about
the
game
some
point
because
can
imagine
that
the
pens
invited
here
for
travel
log
how
not
get
game
time
and
that
front
must
once
again
praise
the
team
for
continuing
invite
bloggers
such
myself
real
live
game
know
the
pirates
did
something
with
bloggers
their
piratefest
this
year
but
guess
invitation
got
lost
cyberspace
can
only
assume
that
the
reasoning
was
the
time
when
was
critical
something
they
done
well
there
goes
opportunity
change
mind
about
how
their
organization
does
things
least
one
franchise
town
gets
for
the
game
the
penguins
have
outshot
the
oilers
and
there
about
minutes
left
the
first
period
that
right
the
oilers
have
one
shot
minutes
too
late
reunite
gretzky
and
messier
hey
tiki
barber
willing
come
back
anything
possible
right
the
pens
kill
off
two
man
advantage
given
the
hopeless
edmonton
power
play
and
follow
that
gooooooooooooal
chris
kunitz
scores
his
the
season
the
period
the
pens
first
goal
since
tuesday
and
was
making
fun
the
oilers
offense
after
the
first
minutes
hockey
penguins
oilers
some
other
first
period
stats
shots
were
pens
hits
were
pens
oilers
were
for
the
and
mrs
malkin
made
one
appearance
the
jumbotron
thunderous
applause
off
and
running
period
and
the
oilers
already
tripled
their
shot
output
from
period
must
have
been
one
heck
locker
room
speech
goal
but
the
net
was
dislodged
goal
but
wait
max
talbot
fakes
devan
dubnyk
out
his
jock
and
lights
the
lamp
for
the
pens
just
moments
later
his
the
season
the
penguins
oilers
chris
kunitz
gets
called
for
slashing
giving
the
oilers
another
crack
power
play
confident
that
this
will
end
well
given
what
seen
from
edmonton
far
today
yeah
that
pretty
much
went
expected
now
let
turn
attention
the
smith
hot
dog
giveaway
unfortunately
not
sitting
section
today
free
official
hot
dog
the
penguins
penalty
the
oilers
means
the
pens
ranked
unit
hits
the
ice
let
keep
our
fingers
crossed
that
three
unsuccessful
power
plays
for
each
team
far
today
other
words
confident
that
all
time
single
game
scoring
records
will
broken
this
afternoon
kiss
cam
time
let
hope
for
some
awkwardness
and
mrs
malkin
close
the
kiss
cam
segment
with
lip
lock
for
the
ages
and
wasn
fast
enough
catch
with
camera
matt
cooke
gets
stopped
nice
chance
doesn
pass
the
opportunity
mix
immediately
afterwards
hey
didn
get
that
article
because
goal
the
combination
tyler
kennedy
and
jordan
staal
put
the
pens
with
about
minute
left
the
second
staal
the
season
cooke
also
gets
assist
now
must
focus
the
dairy
queen
bazooka
blast
time
put
down
the
snacks
and
focus
the
third
period
the
pens
can
close
this
out
and
pitt
scores
seed
tonight
this
should
pretty
good
day
terms
pittsburgh
sports
even
the
pirates
won
and
right

ryan
jones
ruins
maf
shutout
with
his
goal
the
season
the
third
for
the
jinx
you
welcome
alexei
kovalev
been
pretty
quiet
today
penalty
minutes
shot
but
managed
draw
penalty
jeff
petry
someone
can
give
the
pens
some
smelling
salts
this
might
prime
opportunity
for
insurance
goal
the
pens
are
now
for
their
last
power
plays
and
for
their
last
they
haven
scored
goal
the
month
march
not
good
sign
going
into
the
postseason
goal
zbynek
michalek
scores
his
the
season
assist
from
craig
adams
and
max
talbot
not
only
michalek
second
goal
the
season
his
second
the
last
week
pens
the
pens
announce
today
consecutive
sellout
come
long
way
since
the
kansas
city
rumors
while
was
busy
cracking
one
liners
today
the
oilers
have
somehow
closed
the
gap
shots
after
falling
behind
after
one
period
maf
has
quietly
played
solid
game
and
the
defense
has
been
praiseworthy
well
ron
burgundy
and
brick
tamland
prompt
the
cec
faithful
make
loud
noises
moderate
success
that
note
has
really
been
seven
years
since
anchorman
came
into
our
lives
maf
whistled
for
delay
game
served
mike
rupp
that
called
taking
one
for
the
team
six
minutes
this
one
man
down
shawn
horcoff
the
oilers
gets
slapshot
absolutely
blasted
off
his
ankle
close
range
that
had
hurt
but
was
able
skate
off
kris
letang
just
got
absolutely
leveled
behind
the
pens
net
gilbert
brule
let
just
say
that
wasn
appreciated
letang
teammates
ruled
charging
penalty
which
puts
the
penguins
power
play
back
the
ice
pens
power
play
goal
pens
power
play
goal
the
slump
over
chris
kunitz
come
down
pens
oilers
with
chili
was
just
saying
gee
been
while
since
heard
cotton
eyed
joe
got
some
legit
candidates
for
three
stars
today
maf
has
stopped
you
have
think
the
running
tyler
kennedy
dishing
out
assists
like
young
john
stockton
chris
kunitz
has
two
much
needed
goals
with
that
trio
some
order
and
there
have
pens
oilers
nice
win
and
nice
effort
after
saturday
stink
bomb
against
montreal
now
let
hope
the

better
than

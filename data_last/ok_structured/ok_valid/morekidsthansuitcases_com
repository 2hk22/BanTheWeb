and
different
places
even
relating
personal
stories
such
how
lori

without
doubt
though
the
most
fun
have
while
writing
doing
the
research
for

the
bizarre
things
that
people
feel
the
need
complain
about
never
fail
put
huge
smile
face
even
does
come
the
cost
little
bit
faith
mankind
one
day
people
will
stop
complaining
about
silly
things
but
until
that
day
good
know
that
always
have
plenty
material
keep
entertained
you
haven
read
the
first
two
instalments
this
series
you
might

and
now
here
the
latest
collection
trip
advisor
strangest
complaints
part
wanted
nice
view
requested
high
floor
but
they
put
the
floor
that
too
high
also
the
window
didn
open
what
there
had
been
fire
your
plan
case
fire
was
out
the
floor
window
always
wondered
where
superman
stayed
when
was
new
york
thought
that
housekeeping
had
stolen
wallet
but
when
complained
the
front
desk
they
didn
seem
too
interested
gave
real
negative
feel
towards
the
hotel
even
though
later
found
wallet
wife
suitcase
this
seems
little
fishy
every
married
man
know
would
assume
that
his
wife
had
taken
his
wallet
long
before
considering
housekeeping
suspect
the
manager
said
that
gave
upgrade
but
didn
feel
any
more
special
new
room
that
really
what
the
upgrade
about
isn
feeling
more
special
maybe
the
manager
should
have
sent
flowers
and
chocolates
wished
for
the
bed
bigger
could
fitting
all
four
really
really
hope
this
guy
was
traveling
with
kids
yeah
something
like
that
when
got
downstairs
for
breakfast
all
the
food
was
gone
this
ruined
our
entire
vacation
this
person
takes
the
saying
breakfast
the
most
important
meal
the
day
far
literally
the
hotel
across
the
street
from
fire
hall
but
they
look
nothing
like
the
firemen
from
the
calendars
apparently
wife
now
writes
trip
advisor
reviews
lori
dream
vehicle
truck
full
firemen
with
batman
strapped
the
front
although
was
nice
hotel
didn
really
feel
like
got
cents
worth
did
you
use
any
toilet
paper
because
that
should
enough
break
even
rate
like
that
while
sitting
the
bar
the
manager
threatened
with
erection
didn
quiet
down
probably
best
that
don
touch
this
one
housekeeping
only
took
the
cases
empties
from
the
corner
the
room
only
took
how
were
you
even
conscious
enough
write
this
finally
this
guy
may
have
valid
complaint
but
would
have
loved
see
the
hotel
manager
face
when
read
this
one
the
hotel
walls
were
paper
thin
could
hear
everything
from
the
amorous
activities
the
couple
next
door
the
animals
outside
least
hope
the
animals
were
outside

the
jelly
belly
factory
tour
there
only
few
different
ways
that
you
can
win
actual
father
the
year
award
from
your
children
one
rich
and
let
them
whatever
they
want
there
chance
that
happening
our
house
another
way
spend
every
spare
moment
doting
your
children
focusing
solely
their
spiritual
physical
and
educational
needs
while
foregoing
your
own
personal
health
and
well
being
strike
two
for
kids
the
third
method
however
far
easier
path
than
the
other
two
remembering
that
the
only
votes
you
need
for
this
award
are
those
your
children
the
simplest
way
declared
father
the
year
take
your
kids
candy
factory
since
willy
wonka
fictional
this
how
found
ourselves
the
jelly
belly
factory
tour
now
based
out
fairfield
california
the
jelly
belly
company
can
traced
back
almost
years
small
candy
store
belleville
illinois
gustav
goelitz
began
the
company
and
while
the
business
was
successful
enough
passed
down
from
generation
generation
wasn
until
almost
years
later
that
the
company
was
truly
noticed
sometimes
though
who
notices
you
that
makes
all
the
difference
this
case
the
person
doing
the
noticing
was
california
governor
ronald
regan
and
when
governor
regan
became
president
regan
his
trusted
jar
jelly
belly
beans
made
the
move
with
him
washington
eventually
the
world
couldn
help
but
notice
the
ever
present
jar
jelly
beans
the
president
office
and
the
jelly
belly
company
was
finally
brought
the
attention
candy
loving
country
regan
inauguration
captured
jelly
beans
jelly
belly
relocated
fairfield
california
giving
them
years
get
things
smoothed
out
before
our
visit
was
fairly
sure
that
everything
would
prepared
for
our
arrival
coincidentally
years
also
the
amount
lead
time
need
get
kids
out
bed
the
morning
although
will
say
that
the
phrase
time
the
candy
factory
helps
speed
things
along
immensely
arrived
the
jelly
belly
factory
just
after
opened
there
were
plans
take
some
pictures
outside
the
building
before
heading
but
apparently
one
member
our
group
wasn
willing
wait
any
longer
before
getting
inside
upon
entering
the
first
thing
you
going
notice
long
roped
off
queue
area
looks
like
designed
hold
hundreds
people
very
similar
the
line
when
signing
autographs
but
early
sunday
morning
there
were
only
about
people
line
for
tour
realistically
this
about
perfect
number
for
the
factory
tour
allows
everybody
easy
sightlines
everything
and
makes
the
distribution
samples
much
more
expedient
tours
leave
every
minutes
and
last
about
minutes
each
fashion
note
everybody
the
factory
tour
must
wear
hat
you
didn
happen
bring
one
your
own
you
allocated
one
these
premium
pieces
headgear
the
tour
takes
place
elevated
walkway
high
above
the
factory
floor
our
visit
happened
fall
weekend
the
factory
wasn
operating
but
was
still
very
impressive
see
the
amount
and
types
machinery
that
into
producing
the
jelly
beans
there
are
monitors
mounted
all
along
the
walkway
and
each
stop
were
shown
video
clip
about
what
happens
that
area
the
factory
found
really
interesting
but
the
tour
guide
ever
found
anybody
interest
waning
all
she
had
was
start
sentence
with
now
going
let
you
try
sample
and
everybody
head
would
snap
back
around
see
what
kind
treat
was
being
offered
got
try
jelly
beans
both
before
and
after
the
shell
was
applied
and
some
new
and
different
flavors
that
aren
widely
available
just
yet
the
end
the
tour
were
each
given
souvenir
bag
disney
jelly
beans
and
released
into
the
gift
shop
the
way
there
photography
allowed
the
tour
but
they
take
your
picture
before
you
start
and
you
are
given
the
option
buy
copy
the
conclusion
your
tour
the
gift
shop
had
great
sampling
all
their
products
including
stuff
that
only
available
the
factory
itself
daughters
bought
some
harry
potter
jelly
beans
take
home
their
friends
son
found
the
free
samples
fudge
being
given
out
the
chocolate
counter
and
lori
and
loaded
bags
rejects
jelly
belly
runs
pretty
tight
ship
when
comes
the
quality
their
product
only
natural
that
there
are
plenty
beans
produced
that
don
make
into
the
final
product
they
package
these
beans
into
two
pound
bags
and
sell
them
product
called
belly
flops
new
favorite
road
trip
snack
then
came
the
moment
been
waiting
for
daughter
came
and
said
dad
got
something
for
you
expecting
band
play
and
confetti
drop
any
moment
began
get
acceptance
speech
ready
for
father
the
year
award
only
find
out
that
what
daughter
had
were
some
jelly
beans
she
had
picked
out
for
from
the
sample
bar
some
rather
unique
flavors
was
presented
with
three
jelly
beans
try
one
dog
food
flavored
one
rotten
egg
flavored
and
one
barf
flavored
not
exactly
the
kind
reward
you
figure
would
come
with
father
the
year
award
but
reasoned
that
perhaps
was
one
last
test
confirm
worthiness
the
title
dutifully
tried
each
the
three
beans
and
although
suspect
that
some
the
flavoring
may
psychological
each
the
beans
really
were
awful
their
names
would
suggest
amused
the
anguish
face
children
headed
back
off
the
sample
bar
see
what
else
they
could
make
dad
eat
but
patience
was
growing
thin
pulled
wife
aside
and
asked
her
when
could
expect
receive
prestigious
award
after
all
had
brought
children
candy
factory
this
should
done
deal
now
wife
looked
blankly
and
asked
remembered
taking
daughter
the
dentist
just
before
our
trip
course
did
that
bill
for
her
braces
was
the
reason
that
were
san
francisco
and
not
beach
aruba
somewhere
more
exotic
what
did
that
have
with
anything
and
that
when
found
out
that
people
with
braces
aren
allowed
eat
jelly
beans
who
knew
mean
thinking
back
did
remember
daughter
giving
all
her
samples
while
were
the
tour
but
just
assumed
that
was
because
she
was
proud
and
impending
father
the
year
status
apparently
those
words
being
muttered
under
her
breath
weren
actually
words
admiration
had
brought
candy
loving
daughter
candy
factory
full
free
samples
where
she
wasn
actually
allowed
try
anything
whoops
looks
like
another
year
winning
the
worst
father
the
year
award
that
makes
years
row
now
fortunately
have
speech
permanently
prepared

our
sweet
time
getting
around
checking
out
but
sometimes
you
just
have
wait
for
deal
what
counts
that
did
finally
get
there
and
once
got
chance
try
everything
out
loved
our
favorite
ride
was
radiator
springs
racers
disney
did
great
job
building
this
ride
around
their
cars
franchise
and
enjoyed
every
second
our
time
the
ride
unfortunately
for
every
minute
got
spend
the
ride
had
spend
minutes
standing
line

valuable

here
single

took
about
half
long
get
through
the
single
rider
line
did
get
through
the
stand
queue
granted
that
still
involves
investment
least
hour
but
that
way
better
than
the
two
hours
plus
that
the
main
line
was
taking
sunglasses
aesthetic
but
you
going

around

you
really

you
should
really
head
over

check
out
some
the
fantastic
people
that
hang
out
there

most
them
could
probably
described

reasons
not
very
good
road
tripping
have
blog
like
read
called
tips
road
tripping
about
family
six
who
take
these
crazy
long
drives
across
the
country
and
stop
some
the
strangest
places
imaginable
all
while
making
look
like
they
having
the
time
their
lives
highly
suspect
that
someone
that
family
has
taken
photoshop
class
because
they
always
look
happy
enjoy
following
joe
deborah
and
their
family
their
adventures
and
while
always
said
that
road
tripping
wasn
for
secretly
always
wondered
they
were
something
special
fast
forward
this
years
christmas
break
and
circumstances
aka
daughter
deciding
that
she
doesn
want
fly
any
more
led
plan
our
first
real
road
trip
don
count
the
one
direction
version
least
called
road
trip
the
tips
for
road
tripping
gang
would
probably
laugh
simple
hour
drive
but
for
seemed
like
enormous
endeavour
hours
would
easily
the
longest
period
time
that
ever
spent
car
together
excluding
the
time
that
got
lost
driving
edmonton
more
accurate
would
the
longest
period
time
ever
intentionally
spent
car
together
that
scary
thought
dwell
while
loading
luggage
into
the
van
probably
could
have
found
more
comfortable
seating
arrangement
how
was
well
survived
truthfully
was
nowhere
near
bad
thought
was
going
split
the
drive
two
and
stayed
night
portland
both
directions
leaving
only
hour
shifts
behind
the
wheel
which
really
didn
seem
too
terrible
still
not
sure
that
excursion
that
rush
repeat
despite
what
our
friends
tips
road
tripping
say
not
sure
that
road
tripping
for
everyone
and
pretty
sure
not
for
here
five
reasons
fairly
certain
not
well
suited
the
road
tripping
lifestyle
like
control
don
share
the
driving
like
share
the
driving
really
would
but
there
something
that
won
let
truth
told
pilots
are
lucky
let
them
fly
the
plane
without
being
the
cockpit
offering
suggestions
seem
have
some
sort
control
fetish
and
that
makes
for
really
long
days
behind
the
wheel
will
only
get
worse
next
year
when
the
boy
eligible
get
his
drivers
license
there
zero
chance
relinquishing
grip
the
wheel
that
point
plus
there
the
rule
that
the
driver
controls
the
radio
and
all
know
why
that
important
don
apparently
drive
the
world
most
inconvenient
speed
not
speed
demon
but
the
speed
limit
road
mph
then
usually
keep
pace
somewhere
between
mph
that
seems
reasonable
but
for
about
the
drivers
the
last
week
that
the
speed
semi
truck
climbing
degree
incline
while
pulling
trailer
full
anchors
should
traveling
and
must
some
sort
pace
car
moving
slowly
was
the
other
half
the
drivers
obviously
thought
that
was
some
kind
meth
fueled
speed
crazed
canadian
who
had
respect
for
american
speed
limits
add
the
fact
that
actually
signal
when
change
lanes
and
think
everybody
was
completely
confused
driving
habits
the
freedom
stop
wherever
you
want
most
people
who
like
road
tripping
will
tell
you
that
being
able
stop
and
explore
things
that
catch
your
eye
one
the
best
parts
driving
instead
flying
respectfully
disagree
man
and
goal
get
from
point
point
quickly
possible
having
stop
every
time
wife
spots
something
interest
doesn
speed
things
along
all
besides
the
only
thing
that
ever
catches
wife
eye
while
driving
are
outlet
malls
well
that
and
the
occasional
road
sign
which
everybody
feels
the
need
scream
the
top
their
lungs
causing
nearly
drive
the
van
into
the
ditch
the
service
isn
good
flying
those
you
who
think
hassle
trying
get
drink
airline
should
try
and
get
somebody
pass
you
diet
coke
van
three
kids
sitting
the
back
with
their
headphones
and
matter
how
much
wave
and
motion
nobody
looking
from
their
ipad
unless
course
drive
past
the
yolo
county
limit
sign
that
they
all
miraculously
see
lori
isn
much
better
nine
hour
drive
the
perfect
opportunity
for
nine
hour
candy
crush
marathon
that
means
all
drink
requests
have
just
wait
until
finish

level
you
don
get
miles
while

time
passed
sign
detailing
the
remaining
distance
san
francisco
would
mentally
figure
out
how
many
miles
would
earn
our
frequent
flyer
account
stopped
and
flew
from
right
that
point
with
alaska
running
double
miles
most
their
bay
area
routes
right
now
was
little
depressing
keep
figuring
out
what
were
missing
out
fortunately
shouldn
have
miss
out
again
after
two
hour
drives
daughter
has
decided
that
she
perfectly
fine
with
flying
again
apparently
road
trips
are
the
miracle
cure
for
fear
flying
wonder
joe
and
deborah
know

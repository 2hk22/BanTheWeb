spitting
youth
question
referee
has
threatened
report
one
players
for
excessive
spitting
during
match
can
really
this
answer
the
player
question
was
spitting
only
the
ground
and
not
the
direction
someone
else
the
pitch
can
see
there
has
been
any
offence
committed
here
the
act
spitting
may
carry
with
certain
amount
kudos
making
players
feel
grown
manly
and
sporty
but
also
really
important
for
players
play
soccer
feeling
comfortable
that
said
sounds
one
your
players
has
been
rather
over
the
top
with
the
amount
was
spitting
this
should
something
you
must
have
word
with
him
about
for
all
its
usefulness
spitting
still
not
particularly
pleasant
act
and
guess
the
referee
made
light
threat
the
hope
that
your
player
would
knock
the
head
the
referee
has
gone
ahead
and
reported
this
you
should
hear
from
your
league
committee
within
couple
weeks
simply
state
the
player
case
and
explain
that
you
are
putting
measures
place
remind
all
players
the
etiquette
required
when
the
soccer
pitch
but
were
you
wouldn
unduly
worried
about
this

you
will
often
get
asked
parents
what
happened
the
fun
side
soccer
well
this
soccer
drill
not
only
fun
but
should
produce
creative
skillful
soccer
playing
add
bit
flair

route
one

wouldn
normally
advise
route
one
football
but
sometimes
you
want
get
team
the
back
foot
from
the
off
when
first
started
soccer
coaching
was
very
basic
and
unimaginative
with
queues
boys
doing
the
same
old
soccer
drill
lining
shooting
goal
lining
running
through
cones
spoke
about
this
coach
from
top
club
and
said
try
something
different
this
invaluable
soccer
coaching
tip
has
stayed
with
ever
since
and
always
thinking
new
innovative
ways
play
and
drill
teams
that
exactly
what
demba
did
for
besiktas
against
arsenal
this
week
watch
below
and
follow
tips
your
team
can
kick
off
coaching
tip
recent
football
event
where
there
were
teams
and
the
pitches
were
very
small
side
ones
took
player
with
the
best
kick
one
side
and
said
when
you
win
kick
off
just
shoot
the
goal
without
anyone
else
touching
the
ball
this
did
and
duly
scored
the
referee
was
fully
qualified
ref
and
was
mystified
didn
allow
the
goal
that
not
fair
coach
but
went
and
checked
half
time
with
the
guy
who
had
the
rule
book
and
came
back
with
apology
the
law
states
the
ball
must
forward
kick
off
but
does
not
have
touch
another
player
into
the
goal
saw
the
great
socrates
try
once
for
brazil
did
every
match
until
got
the
quarter
finals
but
then
all
the
teams
had
copied
route
one
soccer
drill
this
one
those
soccer
drills
that
you
have
get
your
kids
practise
and
you
only
really
want
one
two
your
players
run
the
drill
simply
put
the
ball
the
centre
spot
and
get
one
them
kick
hard
they
can
give
your
players
five
six
goes
more
and
tell
them
try
their
local
park
they
can
reach
the
goal
worth
shot
could
also
lead
corner
and
your
team
immediately
the
attack
sometimes
you
will
turn
very
small
pitches
and
your
players
will
keen
put
their
skills
the
test

friday
september
riding
shotgun
with
dad
dad
his
garden
front
the
back
forty
grinding
gears
and
dodging
the
ditch
that
cut
hundred
feet
into
our
deep
backyard
learned
drive
volkswagen
beetle
that
had
one
wheel
the
grave
our
family
five
lived
almost
two
acres
that
featured
rear
section
wetlands
called
the
back
forty
dad
transfigured
the
soggy
bottom
with
his
tiller
into
extended
garden
spot
only
see
the
valleys
between
his
neatly
formed
rows
repeatedly
fill
with
the
next
downpour
our
south
mississippi
home
joked
about
growing
rice
but
found
some
success
cultivating
silver
queen
corn
and
okra
the
land
rising
our
house
featured
better
drainage
where
focused
his
gardening
efforts
periodically
the
back
forty
would
return
its
natural
state
when
dad
stopped
tilling
and
mowing
crawdads
loved
pitcher
plants
too
was
here
learned
finesse
the
withered
clutch
and
brake
system
very
tired
and
cranky
old
bug
beneath
feet
the
floorboard
featured
gaping
hole
that
only
fred
flintstone
could
appreciate
driving
through
puddles
meant
your
feet
got
soaked
the
stick
for
the
windshield
wiper
had
long
ago
broken
off
somebody
figured
out
small
flat
head
screwdriver
substituted
nicely
the
hand
cranked
windows
functioned
well
enough
thankfully
the
air
conditioning
was
non
existent
the
time
you
got
the
thing
properly
ventilated
your
feet
appropriately
positioned
and
the
windshield
free
debris
driving
proved
comparatively
simple
endeavor
early
tutelage
dad
would
fold
his
six
foot
two
inch
frame
into
the
shotgun
seat
his
right
arm
braced
the
passenger
window
and
his
left
hand
poking
around
for
toothpick
shoving
his
silver
hair
from
his
sweaty
brow
smelled
wintergreen
skoal
and
old
spice
and
dispensed
short
obvious
commands
like
back
don
hit
the
pontiac
dad
taught
biological
sciences
for

teaching
was
second

whining
was

exuded
the
kind
calm
most
folks
appreciate
when
their
nerves
are
raw
and
learning
new
skill
whether
that
was
mastering
the
release
clutch
and
application
gas
rustic
car
skinning
cats
for
dissection
his
was
the
kind
patience
wish
could
mass
produce
cure
all
for
anger
and
apathy
and
distribute
needed
elixir
quincy
long
driving
lessons
with
dad
left
laughing
hysterically
feigned
cardiac
arrest
white
knuckled
panic
and
bladder

real

what

looped
through
evenly
spaced
azaleas
turned
dime
past
the
burn
pile
skirted
the
perimeter
without
damaging
the

much
and
found
liberty
behind
the
wheel
when
wildly
ventured
out
open
road
more
years
have
passed
than
care
count
since
those
days
lurching
past

the
closeness

with

uncharacteristic
for
august
south
mississippi
dare
say
felt
like
fall
seldom
speak
openly
autumn
here
for
fear
frightening
away
offending
the
sun
gods
but
the
cool
air
and
the
morning
sun
lifted
spirits
turned
the
radio
little
louder
than
usual
unexpected
joy
settled
smile
that
turned

corners
surly
scowl
there
was
that
accepting
look

has

all

dreaming
hot

the

wrapping
blankets
and
walking
outside
without
breaking
sweat
definitely
magic
the
music
the
radio
song
pink
challenged
you
gotta
get
and
try
considering
previous
week
struggling
with
complete
lack
energy
and
enthusiasm
the
message
struck
chord
and
then
for
reason
all
thought
the
song
piano
man
love
the
lyrics
about
vocalist
bar
piano
singing
the
stories
his
hard
luck
audience
from
man
making
love
his
tonic
and
gin
pounding
carnival
chords
from
the
keyboard
picture
young
billy
joel
writing
that
song
and
wonder
just
what
inspired
him
tell
that
story
what
moment
did
recognize
the
significance
composing
his
song
now
share
this
story
for
only
one
reason
clearly
crazy
which
think
you
have
least
little
things
like
write
stories
and
share
them
for
anyone
eyes
but
your
own
but
what
happened
next
made
understand
some
intrinsically
cellular
level
that
god
billy
joel
maybe
the
unicorns
large
needed
hear
something
you
know
those
moments
when
you
feel
connected
something
someone
beyond
yourself
that
you
cast
suspicious
glance
over
your
shoulder
candid
camera
there
secret
webcam
here
dreaming
that
very
instant
piano
man
sailed
from
the
speakers

mean
soon
pink
finished
her
call
perseverance
billy
joel
serenaded
all
the
way
dollar
general
not
sure
exactly
why
but
cried
felt
instantaneously
connected
with
something
good
like
suddenly
reuniting
with
the
very
best
friend
ever
ever
had
but
why
because
timing
everything
people
some
would
say
jesus
some
would
say
buddha
calling
some
would
say
screw
loose
and
all
just
stupid
coincidence
but
allowed
myself
have
that
moment
clarity
considered
that
song
played
for
reason
when
could
have
easily
been
one
countless
others
wasn
just
any
song
was
the
one
that
led
back
writing
something
good
for
soul
made
revisit
own
purpose
writing
and
how
love
spend
time
with
words
the
piano
man
sang
memory
and
after
long
absence
from

hope
that
you

tuesday
september
our
spotted
hound
says
goodbye
they
don
write
obituaries
for
dogs
least
they
don
run
them
newspapers
but
like
many
families
with
pets
ours
feels
compelled
honor
the
memory
our
lost
canines
and
cats
with
something
more
than
swift
and
painful
goodbye
the
veterinarian
office
which
what
happened
yesterday
with
our
dear
old
boy
spottie
spottie
found
years
ago
showed
out
nowhere
our
front
yard
and
cast
spell
over
our
then
seven
year
old
son
sam
the
boy
presented
his
newfound
friend
the
mother
all
soft
hearts
and
announced
that
was
keeping
him
there
was
collar
identification
his
owners
wouldn
have
mattered
seen
lot
bonding
periods
between
dogs
and
kids
never
has
there
been
one
that
melded
any
faster
you
would
have
come
closer
separating
oxygen
from
the
air
with
garden
rake
course
the
instant
new
dog
appeared
the
premises
our
daughter
katie
wasted
time
loving
him
there
was
something
about
that
tailless
white
dog
with
black
spots
and
pointy
ears
that
proved
dogs
have
souls
spottie
arrived
full
grown
probably
year
old
but
acted
like
very
old
friend
someone
who
already
knew
your
heart
and
where
find
the
bacon
fortunately
for
one
came
claim
him
husband
steve
made
meager
attempt
establish
spottie
outside
dog
that
lasted
about
two
hours
just
long
enough
endear
himself
his
new
daddy
and
our
beloved
winnie
dog
who
was
dying
cancer
she
accepted
him
without
question
and
spottie
found
himself
inside
belly
the
carpet
further
upping
the
ante
just
how
completely
irresistible
this
angel
dog
could
life
loves
show
that
timing
everything
don
believe
for
second
that
spottie
materialized
out
nowhere
accident
slipped
seamlessly
into
our
lives
and
eased
our
grief
when
took
winnie
that
last
car
ride
the
vet
spottie
more
than
filled
the
space
was
obedient
yet
playful
loyal
yet
friendly
fearless
yet
gentle
the
dog
was
our
super
hero
calming
constant
throughout
the
years
who
won
favor
with
everyone
even
our
sore
tailed
cat
matilda
astounding
consider
our
children
were
second
grade
and
kindergarten
when
graced
with
his
presence
they
are
now
college
when
you
are
dog
lover
and
you
live
long
enough
you
will
doubt
feel
the
loss
beloved
friend
words
never
much
shore
during
this
kind
loss
but
memories
have
way
soothing
the
raw
edges
especially
when
those
memories
evoke
the
undeniable
solace
unconditional
love
age
and
arthritis
took
their
toll
spottie
was
blind
and
deaf
and
diabetic
his
hindquarters
hadn
worked
well
years
stairs
proved
his
most
formidable
foe
never
stopped
though
showed
how
with
the
flow
and
recognize
the
simple
rewards
ordinary
days
where
tummy
rub
and
piece
cheese
can
pretty
darned
awesome
spottie
taught
well
lived
exemplary
life
love
trust
tolerance
and
forgiveness
even
for
matilda
would
remind
even
today
especially
today
that
life
gift
opportunity
simply
the
good
and
constant
friend
the
lives
others
and
then
there
spaghetti
there
always
glorious
spaghetti

katie
katie
mowhen
was
kid
didn
give
much
thought
the
fact
that
didn
have
sister
had
twin
brothers
six
years
junior
didn
have
time
for
sisters
plus
heard
the
horror
stories
sisters
swiping
each
other
stuff
sibling
sabotage
sinister
only
sister
with
sisters
could
understand
guess
times
was
actually
glad
not
have
sister
then
one
day
became
mom
for
the
second
time
daughter
suddenly
there
was
new
and
spectacular
female
voice
within
the
family
know
lot
mothers
claim
strong
bonds
with
their
baby
girls
birth
but
there
truly
was
something
extraordinary
about
ours
she
completed
mary
katherine
slept
all
night
her
first
night
home
she
rarely
complained
cooed
this
incredibly
adorable
sound
that
proved
impossible
resist
and
exuded
contentment
she
begged
attention
not
because
she
demanded
but
because
she
was
completely
lovable
endearing
and
funny
she
always
slept
with
her
arms
thrust
directly
above
her
head
when
pick
her
from
her
nap
she
looked
like
miniature
sumo
wrestler
hence
her
nickname
katie
she
watched
every
move
her
brother
made
her
greatest
frustration
baby
was
the
fact
that
she
could
not
walk
and
talk
like
him
her
greatest
satisfaction
was
hold
his
attention
for
even
few
uninterrupted
seconds
whether
realized
the
time
not
sam
had
the
ultimate
sister
she
idolized
him
katie
turned
march
she
come
long
way
from
that
nearly
bald
bundle
drooling
giggling
glee
have
marveled
how
intelligent
and
capable
she
wondered
over
how
that
steven
and
landed
such
truly
remarkable
daughter
she
beautiful
inside
and
out
and
treasure
our
time
together
dad
said
best
she
one
kind
and
though
for
some
inexplicable
reason
she
has
been
saddled
with
medical
disorder
that
defies
definition
she
remains
that
completely
lovable
endearing
and
funny
gal
who
won
our
hearts
years
ago
times
her
pain
and
physical
challenges
have
been
more
than
any
kid
should
have
endure
she
has
weathered
ridicule
misunderstanding
and
alienation
from
people
who
should
have
known
better
she
harbors
anger
grudge
spite
having
every
right
she
has
shown
strength
character
and
powerful
will
the
face
daunting
discomfort
and
exhaustion
her
faith
unwavering
her
spirit
undaunted
she
doesn
have
sense
smell
something
didn
determine
until
she
was
nearly
years
old
why
did
take
long
she
resourceful
just
didn
see
the
deficit
because
she
never
realized
she
had
one
still
laugh
when
think
about
taking
her
bath
and
body
works
and
asking
her
sniff
dozen
fragrances
more
she
thought
was
crazy
and
thought
she
was
odd
say
they
all
smell
good
guess
have
laughed
harder
and
longer
and
more
gratefully
with
her
because
anyone
who
can
find
the
funny
among
countless
needles
and
pills
and
procedures
bordering
torture
inevitably
can
make
even
the
most
stolid
ice
queen
crack
smile
she
takes
one
day
time
and
makes
each
one
richer
for
the
rest
never
had
sister
with
because
have
daughter

one
bit
energy
left
spare
she
give
willingly
just
about
anyone
she
was
giver
never
taker
with
her
you
always
felt
worthwhile
and
cherished
and
that
important
did
you
ever
love
dog
who
could
make
you
laugh
and
cry
within
the
same
breath
dogs
are
incredibly
gifted
that
way
our
winnie
chewed
new
shoes
ripped
the
insulation
from
beneath
our
rental
house
and
rolled
putrid
carcasses
every
opportunity
but
she
had
way
with
our
children
that
made
know
they
would
never
lack
for
champion
protector
devoted
friend
that
crazy
yellow
hound
always
made
feel
comforted
and
that
important
will
you
remember
countless
hours
spent
the
business
raising
children
kids
are
enormous
investments
time
they
come
into
this
world
our
invitation
completely
dependent
our
ability
provide
there
this
blur
birthday
parties
tooth
fairy
visits
and
award
ceremonies
that
find
difficult
recall
but
once
stood
beneath
the
boughs
newly
leafed
pecan
trees
our
back
yard
watching
small
son
and
daughter
sleep
stroller
while
the
warmth
spring
and
the
promise
the
future
rushed
with
unforgettable
gratitude
can
still
remember
every
subtle
nuance
that
ordinary
day
moments
like
that
make
parent
feel
utterly
complete
and
that
important
can
you
sing
something
for
every
season
read
stories
that
inspire
you
dance
for
the
purpose
just
pure
indulgence
and
love
unconditionally
have
you
forgiven
the
unforgiveable
and
received
the
same
you
laugh
often
and
loudly
especially
yourself
when
you
find
solace
and
reassurance
based
innate
and
unfailing
faith
that
much
part
you
your
dna
you
nice
things
for
others
because
you
want
not
because
someone
looking
somewhere
your
history
have
you
ever
taken
the
time
write
letter
someone
for
the
sole
purpose
reminding
them
that
they
are
loved
they
are
special
and
they
matter
because
these
are
the
things
that
make
our
lives
humans
worthwhile
and
enjoyable
and
that
important
the
slideshow
watched
the
author
reminds
that
while
most
can
name
various
top
tens
among
celebrities
athletes
historical
figures
will
remember
the
names
people
who
made
difference
our
lives
the
teachers
the
friends
the
mentors
some
people
like
whoever
created
that
slideshow
take
the
time
remind
the
rest
that
kindness
compassion
and
good
sense
humor
make
all
our
lives
richer
and
far
more
memorable
and
that
really
important

doing
business
your
friedly
kangaroo
doing
business
your
friendly
kangaroo
daughter
has
chronic
health
issues
that
have
led
our
family
some
pretty
interesting
trips
medical
destinations
near
and
far
while
continue
the
pursuit
unifying
diagnosis
she
has
adopted
approach
laughter
the
best
medicine
and
tries
take
one
day
time
sometimes
those
days
find
the
road
and
out
our
minds
our
family
four
set
out
for
mayo
clinic
rochester
one
late
october
afternoon
stopped
for
dinner
drove
bit
then
nature
called
and
pulled
into
the
next
quick
stop
katie
headed
directly
the
ladies
room
while
her
brother
dad
and
browsed
the
aisles
immersed
ourselves
shopping
beginning
with
rack
tee
shirts
emblazoned
with
biker
motifs
and
state
logos
moved
onto
the
candy
section
followed
the
chips
and
crackers
checked
out
the
hot
bar
the
coffee
station
the
ice
cream
freezer
and
the
automotive
supplies
after
minutes
had
passed
and
were
reduced
second
guessing
our
snacking
selections
surmised
things
might
not
going
well
the
bathroom
just
then
cell
phone
vibrated
purse
made
way
the
bathroom
extracted
phone
and
noted
the
incoming
caller
was
katie
why
she
calling
from
the
bathroom
asked
myself
this
can
good
pictured
the
possible
scenarios
head
out
toilet
paper
massive
regurgitation
explosive
diarrhea
treacherous
combination
all
three
who
knew
what
lay
the
other
side
that
restroom
door
answered
the
phone
hey
girl
what
going
there
mooooooooommmmmm
finally
why
didn
anybody
answer
their
stupid
phone
geeze
thought
all
had
left
somehow
this
high
decibel
screech
comforted
she
was
breathing
she
was
conscious
and
she
was
some
kind
mad
bravely
motioned
the
others
that
was
going
whoa
calm
down
way
there
are
you
just
get
here
hurry
and
with
that
the
phone
went
dead
was
just
past
the
oatmeal
cakes
and
almost
the
nuts
and
pork
rinds
when
unsuspecting
woman
cut
front
and
headed
toward
the
sign
marked
women
mind
raced
considered
the
very
real
possibility
that
this
gal
might
soon
rendered
completely
senseless
noxious
fumes
worse
but
was
helpless
stop
her
she
heaved
the
door
inward
and
what
appeared
vacuous
hole
pitch
black
darkness
suddenly
erupted
into
glowing
cubicle
searing
white
light
that
split
second
the
ears
every
creature
within
ten
mile
radius
would
splinter
with
the
guttural
boom
that
echoed
from
the
confines
single
bathroom
stall
kangaroo
quick
stop
near
memphis
thank
you
would
have
loved
see
the
expression
that
woman
face
upon
her
triumphal
entry
but
she
ducked
for
cover
the
stall
next
katie
before
could
gauge
her
reaction
what
did
see
was
completely
benign
bathroom
environment
remarkably
clean
actually
thankfully
smelled
harmlessly
like
lemon
cleaner
what
heard
was
far
more
sinister
daughter
doesn
cuss
but
the
blend
growls
and
pitches
behind
that
metal
door
sounded
much
like
the
kind
muffled
swearing
grown
ups
use
the
presence
children
and
clergy
indecipherable
but
clearly
not
born
happy
thoughts
and
well
wishes
katie
are
you
yes
now
that
can
see
what
doing
yes
just
fine
this
was
followed
several
spins
the
toilet
paper
dispenser
more
grumbling
and
the
type
telltale
noises
that
make
mom
know
her
services
are
longer
needed
waited
outside
few
minutes
later
the
girl
child
emerged
anyone
with
female
adolescent
offspring
can
testify
the
fact
that
when
they
are
ticked
off
you
best
give
them
plenty
time
and
space
decompress
the
problem
this
particular
scenario
that
were
all
about
crawl
into
minivan
together
and
finish
what
was
left
hour
drive
the
northern
limits
these
expansive
united
states
geeze
katie
what
took
long
her
brother
asked
which
she
replied
grrrrrrrrr
but
her
credit
the
outrageous
circumstances
evoked
appropriate
hilarity
her
part
and
within
minutes
were
all
laughing
like
bunch
baboons
big
banana
high
apparently
this
particular
bathroom
came
equipped
with
energy
saving
sensor
that
turned
out
the
lights
when
movement
detected
after
certain
period
time
maybe
five
minutes
into
her
bathroom
retreat
all
went
black
you
try
doing
what
you
need
the
toilet
when
you
can
even
see
your
hand
front
your
face
she
spat
she
had
called
and
didn
answer
because
two
phones
were
the
van
and
one
was
vibrate
purse
her
only
safe
option
was
wait
the
dark
the
pot
wondering
why
her
family
had
abandoned
her
all
well
that
ends
well
but
have
wonder
what
that
woman
thought
when
she
was
welcomed
with
such
vigorous
and
appreciative
cheers
she
entered
the
bathroom
perhaps
she
chalked
superior
customer
service
big
thank
you
for
doing
business
your
friendly
kangaroo

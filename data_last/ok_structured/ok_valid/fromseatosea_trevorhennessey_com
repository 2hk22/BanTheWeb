doing
name
trevor
hennessey
and
the
summer
bicycled
across
canada
from
crescent
beach
the
west
coast
johns
the
east
coast
set
website
friends
and
family
could
follow
along
with
journey
and
this
transcript
that
journey
bicycle
across
canada
are
you
nuts
although
people
may
not
come
out
and
directly
say
this
when
tell
them
what
did
find
that
usually
inferred
the
conversation
the
reason
undertook
this
endeavor
was
have
the
opportunity
see
more
this
grand
country
that
among
million
other
people
call
home
the
actual
idea
bicycling
across
canada
come
while
was
working
montreal
found
that
loved
living
new
city
and
enjoyed
experiencing
culture
other
than
the
one
grew
with
matter
what
some
people
say
quebec
truly
different
from
with
this
realization
had
the
desire
experience
the
rest
canada
and
what
better
way
than
bicycle
but
why
not
car
train
the
answer
this
quite
simple
just
tourists
can
truly
experience
paris
flying
monday
and
out
sunday
neither
can
one
truly
experience
the
prairies
while
encased
metal
box
moving
instead
they
would
missing
out
the
sounds
the
wind
rustling
through
the
fields
wheat
and
all
the
other
aspects
nature
there
more
canada
than
hwy
and
truly
get
taste
the
country
you
need
get
know
the
people
who
live
there
bicycle
have
the
opportunity
move
slower
pace
fully
discover
the
areas
pass
through
and
yet
still
able
cover
enough
distance
each
day
cross
the
country
somewhat
timely
manner
when
traveling
bicycle
also
have
the
chance
meet
the
most
interesting
people
lodging
tent
but
when
looking
for
place
camp
for
the
night
just
start
knocking
farm
doors
asking
can
pitch
tent
out
their
barn
more
often
than
not
will
offered
shower
and
hot
meal
two
things
that
are
always
appreciated
this
manner
the
true
character
the
region
revealed
why
now
the
main
reason
for
choosing
the
trip
the
time
did
was
quite
simple
had
the
time
had
just
graduated
from
simon
fraser
university
with
and
really
needed
some
time
recuperate
from
the
previous
years
study
how
long
did
the
trip
take
well
when
left
had
hoped
back
home
the
start
september
but
had
real
deadline
and
was
enjoying
the
scenic
route
ended
taking
nearly
four
months
and
complete
disclaimer
website
was
originally
started
that
friends
and
family
back
home
could
follow
along
with
trip
well
with
all
the
publicity
page
has
gotten
readership
has
jumped
far
beyond
this
because
this
felt
that
should
add
small
disclaimer
for
those
you
not
familiar
with
and
story
please
understand
that
most
entries
are
written
late
night
after
over
bicycling
that
time
emotions
are
laid
bare
for
all
see
and
heart
sleeve
rough
days
may
make
broad
sweeping
negative
statements
which
reflect
how
feeling
that
time
these
may
sometimes
come
across
overly
harsh
when
did
not
mean
for
that
way
meant
only
refer
small
subset
people
could
have
edited
out
those
portions
later
but
felt
that
order
for
you
truly
feel
felt
needed
leave
them
please
read
with
this
mind
and
enjoy
thank
you

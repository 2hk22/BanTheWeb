road
trip
through
switzerland
italy
austria
around
interlaken
switzerland
since
the
days
for
the
summer
were
coming
end
and
good
enough
vacation
days
left
out
planned
taking
vacation
and
doing
road
trip
through
switzerland
italy
austria
and
back
germany
was
pretty
much
looking
forward
for
this
trip
wanted
drive
some
the
swiss
italian
austrian
alps
mountain
passes
which
are
closed
during
winter
time
plan
was
drive
through
switzerland
italy
and
then
back
germany
through
austria
normally
most
the
germans
here
drive
through
austria
brenner
pass
after
innsbruck
italy
switzerland
other
alternative
but
much
expensive
than
austria
you
would
have
buy
vignette
motorway
ticket
for
the
whole
year
which
costs
around
euros
the
flip
side
austria
has
vignette
for
week
couple
weeks
months
etc
which
more
flexible
option
decided
through
switzerland
just
because
wanted
drive
through
the
alps
mountain
passes
and
also
meet
some
friends
mine
who
are
located

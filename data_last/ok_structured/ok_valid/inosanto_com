are
all
climbing
different
paths
through
the
mountain
life
and
have
all
experienced
much
hardship
and
strife
there
are
many
paths
through
the
mountain
life
and
some
climbs
can
felt
like
the
point
knife
some
paths
are
short
and
others
are
long
who
can
say
which
path
right
wrong
the
beauty
truth
that
each
path
has
its
own
song
and
you
listen
closely
you
will
find
where
you
belong
climb
your
own
path
true
and
strong
but
respect
all
other
truths
for
your
way
for
them
could

certainly
more

think
about

ones

pretty
sure
any

the

that
egs

have

don
miss
event
and
kamionka

knew
was
the

thing
that
would
draw
true

the

advice
run

beew

take
the

the
only
thing

was
their

honoring

think
the
good

lagunitas
would
say

got
nice

and
ibu
ipa
right
here
full
disclosure
lagunitas
actually
self
describes
the

battle

but
not
the
noble
way
presented
the
hbw
site
lagunitas
says
from
our
earliest
days
striving
make
consistently
good
beer
and
instead
making
beer
that
ranged
from
vile
barely
drinkable
wonderful
elegant
questionable
best
from
being
castigated
our
west
marin
neighbors
finally
suffering
eviction
our
west

from

into

onto

many
time
myself
get
this
they
are
not
about

they
are
about
making
amazing
creative

flavorful
beers
haven

the

the
way

anything
like

dauphin

rescind
every

owns
kamionka
has
limited
the
places

pints
that
could
game
changers
the
success
beer
week
beer

should
increase
the
visibility
local

through

education
beer

should
involve
the

breweries
restaurants
pubs
caterers
retailers
entertainers

other

with
ties
the
craft
beer
community
beer

should
collection
curated

spanning

primary
purpose
the
promotion
and
celebration
independent
craft
beer
beer

should
not
single

doing

job
holding

and
then
slapping

how
much
more
fun
would
this

have
been
just
few
the
partnerships
listed
above
had
been
asked
involved
hbw
events
not
promote
craft

essentially
have
blackjack

stuff
your

crab

turkey

dinner
concert
burlesque
show
and
chili
buffet
each
with

being
handed
out
discussing
the
nightly

one
friend
said
think
the
burlesque
show
particularly
distasteful
and
yet
not
surprising
all
guess
should
glad
didn
schedule
the
little
people
circus
again
ask
for
people
bring
panties
string

philly

has
much
going

just

round

too
crowded

can
just
walk

find

the

harrisburg
beer
week
has
commercial
web
site
listing
single
corporation
events
for
the
week
which
purposely
did
not
link
during

because
really
just
about
profits
for
one
corporation
and
not
for
the
love
beer
realize
that
harrisburg
philadelphia
but
there
are
many
people
and
resources
that
could
drawn
upon
breweries
pubs
homebrew
clubs
like
rehab
distributors
restaurants
public
transit
companies
and
beer
enthusiasts
such
the
hummelstown
beer
nutz
throughout
the

could
have
and
should
have
been
called

lamented
that

surely
feel
the

lifted
hiring

clearly
area
residents

visitors
from

cannot
resist
the

paired
with
the

imperial
pint
glass
this
beer
was
pitch
black
with
dense
and
creamy
thick
tan
head
made
with
local
wilbur
chocolate
and
what
was
described
peanut
butter
powder
perhaps
dehydrated
peanut
butter
and
the
aroma
off
the
glass
was
like
splitting
open
fresh
peanut
butter
egg
the
flavor
was
well
balanced
like
the
darkest
chocolate
cake
blended
with
savory
peanut
butter
frosting
has
lingering
chocolate
flavor
blended
with
light
hop
bitterness
and
subtle
peanut
butter
sweetness
that
masks
the
abv
making
for
perfectly
drinkable
pint
good
could
drink
again
and
again
did
little
searching
and
learned
another
beer
with
this

tap
this

that
coming

goober

these
were
both
pretty
good
but
the
porter
went
way
too
light
the
peanut

flavor
and
uber
goober
had
sour
untertones
stale
legumes
other

beer
news
has
anyone

blogger
there
made
laugh
with
her
quote
only
tried
this
because
had
peanut

had
huge
peanut

nose
which
was
super
interesting
then
made
the
mistake
and
tasted
wheat

lager
grossness
but
since
she
also
didn
like
new
glarus
raspberry
tart
not
sure
have
similar
opinions
you
ever
doubted
that
peanut

and
chocolate
belong
together
beer
get
yourself

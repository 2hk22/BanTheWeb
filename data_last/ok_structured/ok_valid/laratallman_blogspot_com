sunday
march
greeting
from
hays
kansas
never
been
here
before
haven
blogged
many
months
but
decided
time
get
back
also
saves
time
catching
all
you
who
happen
care
with
crazy
life
illustrious
business
partner
not
fan
writing
finds
style
lacking
and
not
wrong
but
many
people
tell
should
write
book
and
think
should
least
remember
these
stories
that
when
old
and
slow
can
remember
that
was
once
little
more
fun
know
gone
grammatically
wrong
several
times
that
paragraph
but
just
don
care
read
along
with
that
disclaimer
how
did
end
here
and
what
the
heck
was
thinking
setting
out
this
adventure
myself
been
searching
for
just
the
right
truck
for
the
team
and
finally
found
her
knoxville
flew
into
nashville
was
much
cheaper
southwest
ended
killing
some
time
there
before
driving
over
knoxville
since
they
didn
have
her
ready
course
wandered
downtown
nashville
and
went
place
called
etch
where
ate
roasted
cauliflower
with
smoked
pea
pesto
and
gingered
grits
with
cranberries
wow
when
made
the
truck
she
wasn
quite
road
worthy
had
run
around
and
sort
that
out
before
getting
the
road
hours
late
the
tractor
volvo
with
the
big
cummins
engine
and
holds
gallons
fuel
the
math
and
yes
named
her
bessie
because
she
pretty
big
girl
for
those
you
who
don
have
family
history
dairy
cattle
this
common
name
for
cow
she
been
little
neglected
but
far
has
run
like
trooper
our
research
decided
volvo
was
the
way
and
know
now
that
was
the
right
choice
the
dash
and
seating
position
are
much
more
comfortable
and
adjustable
and
the
auto
shift
works
really
well
knew
there
were
couple
big
storms
stayed
south
and
then
tried
make
run
north
between
them
this
didn
entirely
work
but
looking
the
weather
maps
today
don
think
there
was
any
avoiding
things
made
after
dealing
with
freezing
rain
snow
and
ice
for
about
hours
and
only
making
about
miles
felt
good
able
run
bessie
mph
after
going
very
very
slowly
most
the
day
while
driven
the
snow
lot
never
seen
freezing
rain
like
this
came
down
large
balls
slush
that
instantly
froze
the
truck
early
the
day
the
washer
fluid
froze
forcing
stop
frequently
and
knock
the
ice
the
blades
and
windshield
could
barely
stand
the
truck
stop
parking
lot
you
can
imagine
get
lot
weird
looks
when
get
out
the
truck
and
put
gloves
get
work
but
more
that
another
time
had
the
option
heading
all
the
way
north
from
wichita
but
turns
out
darn
sick
also
really
dislike
nebraska
sorry
jason
lowe
cows
corn
and
football
just
don
for
will
making
drive
through
nebraska
again
friday
travel
sebring
once
week
more
than
enough
also
once
yelped
the
situation
and
found
there
was
better
food
the
was
definitely
staying
south
that
how
ended
hays
very
small
place
but
just
had
good
meal
gella
diner
and
brew
pub
which
was
voted
small
brewer
the
year
the
great
american
brew
pub
festival
and
now
happily
working

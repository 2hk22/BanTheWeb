before
releasing

claims
perfectly
safe
and
will
help
you
train
your
dog
quickly
every
time
your
dog
does
something
shouldn
you
can
send
short
electric
signal
ranging
from
one
ten
pulses
one
second
that
will
cause
muscle
contraction
this
method
claimed
harmless
the

low
voltage
and
the
effect
the
same
you
poured
water
your
dog
while
the
collar
dealing
low
intensity
electric
shock
the
dog
owner
should
vocally
warn
the

dog
will
confused
but
after

would
understood
the
more
classical
manner
training
this
way
dog
will
quickly
associate
the
words
and
tone
with
the
shock
and
will
listen
you
even
after

the
time
needed
for
training
and
you
needed
month

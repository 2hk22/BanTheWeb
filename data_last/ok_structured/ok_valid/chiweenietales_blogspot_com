about
some
scary

somewhat
funny
occurrences
with
leila
see
often
take
her
out
our
backyard
play
with
her
stick
she
usually
brings
the
stick
back
for
four
five
throws
then
starts
circling
around
and
eventually
eating
some
deer
poop
that
when
usually
bring

the
house
sometimes
though
our
neighbor
dog
out
really
old
dog
and
has
low
rumbling
bark
whenever
leila
sees
the
dog
she
immediately
runs
over
him
she
runs
close
him
then
darts
back
out
and
out
and
out
sometimes
she
even
run
onto
our
neighbor
deck
and
stand
next
their
sliding
door
you
can
imagine
nightmare
get
her
back
often

listens
and
comes
sprinting
back
through

leila
yelping
for
today
blog
tell
you
about
leila
noisy
yet
cute
yelping
whenever
all
sitting
the
family
room
leila
usually
likes
lie
the
edge
the
couch
she
can
look
out
the
window
all
doing
our
own
thing
when
suddenly
hear
low
grumbling
sound
followed
some
high
pitched
squeaks
looking
out
the
window
see
couple
walking
together
neighbor
doing
some
yardwork
before
know
leila
frenzy
running
from
window
window
harping
like
she
some
terrible
pain
her
tail
wags
but
her
voice
suggests
uneasy
curiosity
after
few
minutes
leila
winds
down
expunging
few
last
squeaks
from
her
snout
and
the
next
instant
she
plopped
down
the
couch
staring
out
the
window
once
more
how
cute
she

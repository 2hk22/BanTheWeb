over

over

the

targeted
the

who
exactly
will

saturday
qpr

tweeted

who

keen
mar
was
just
this
one
off
tweet
from
the
chairman
expressing
his
own
views
rather
than
the
corporate
entity
this
case
seemingly
like
warren
farm
which
the
club
owners
have
evolving
attitude
towards
what
they
will
building
the
basis
over
years
fan
support
for
qpr
and
the
size
their
fan
support
one
can
make
very
good
case
for
smaller
size
stadium
ideally
with
potential
for
future
growth
the
primary
criteria
the
multi
purpose
usage
and
the
belief
that
larger
size
stadium
necessary
for
that
along
with
hypothetically
greater
growth
support
for
qpr
and
neutrals
coming
watch
the
team
case
can
certainly
made
either
way
many
fans
would
probably
welcome
smaller
stadium
either
way
certain
consistency
might
nice
though
maybe
the
club
truly
hasn
decided
size
which
case
maybe
should
make
that
clear
obviously
behind
all
this
there
the
fact
that
there
may
not
new
stadium
unless
the
london
authorities
give
the
ahead

over
the
past
couple
seasons

have
spent
big
close
the
gap
united
such
extent
that
this
game
may
bring
reality
check
these
two
teams
title
ambitions
win
for
city
would
close
the
gap
their
arch
rivals
points
win
occassions
like
these
are
always
huge
morale
boost
either
side
united
who
had
gone

need
get

previous
meeting
this
season
was
dull
goalless
affair
with
both
the
teams
playing
negative
formation
trying
avoid
defeat
the
game
was
pretty
lackluster

had

this

has
been
terrific

always
trusts
fletcher
the
big
games
expect
him
given
the
nod
tomorrow
fletcher
will
use
his
boundless
energy
close
down
city
midfield
and
will
try
nullify
yaya

from
getting
further
the
pitch
the
reverse
fixture
yaya
toure
rarely
got
forward

expect
him
tomorrow
looking
the
way
the
league
moving
city
will
have
balanced
approach
the
game
rather
than
the
defensive

they
took

city
creative
force
this
season
has
taken
his
time
settle
down
but
now
finding
his
feet
the
premier
league
silva
will
look
drift
inside
and
exploit
the
spaces
behind
united
midfield
duo
and
pull
the
string
midfield
with
his
clever
one

nani
like
wise
has
been

spark
this
season
and
leads
the

hot
and
cold
too
often
excellent
well
frustrating
moments
within

has
made
his
most
admirable
fans
sigh

prediction
manchester
united
manchester
city
seems
crucial
for
both
the
teams
win
this
clash
not
just
for
pride
but
the
title
hopes
too
depend
the
result
its
must
win
for
manchester
united
side
they
have
meet
the
realistic
target
points
set
their
manager
sir
alex
ferguson
and
for
manchester
city
they
want
stay
the

new
site
that
allows
buyers
and
sellers
find
each
other
this
site
here
provide
potential
snail
owners
with
information
keeping
snails
pets
hopefully
this
site
will
tell
you
all
you
need
get
started
many
cases
the
information
quite
detailed
and
not
all
will
interest
use
everyone
that
end
may
fail
just
the
basics
please
kind
site
however
this
site
was
born
from
hunger
for
snail
information
and
the
struggle
find
don
misled
that
there
are
great
sites
out
there
but
they
all
contain
varying
levels
detail
and
focus
most
hobbyists
tend
get
carried
away
with
their
hobby
and
thirst
for
information
this
site
intended
fulfil
that
thirst
and
provide
newcomers
with
all
the
information
they
may
desire
point
reference
for
existing
snail
owners
hopefully
the
information
that
here
currently
and
the
contributions
from
other
snail
owners
will
become
point
reference
for
both
newcomers
and
more
experienced
people
alike
also
link
more
detailed
information
other
sites

possible

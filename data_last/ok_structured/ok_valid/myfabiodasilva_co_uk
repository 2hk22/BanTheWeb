started
emerge
linking
the
argentine

who
was
signed
the
new
coach
the

even
with

john

the

newcastle

coloccini
was
still
being
viewed
someone
who
can
have
managerial
role
the
premier
league
but
things
have
started
fall
apart
for
fabriciocoloccini
his
latest
performances
have
been
heavily
critiqued
coloccini
received
red
card
when
newcastle
united
faced
off
with
everton

the
current
year
and
the
influential
defender
now
being

are
few
players

continued
their
poor

with

this

the

the
worst
his

tenure
the

been
unable

after
taking

this
defeat
against

was
the
third
consecutive
for
the
team
all
competitions
the
last
two
defeats
have
come
the
championship
and
this
likely
the
biggest
priority
for
the
club
those
defeats
have
seen
cardiff
slip
place
the
table
even
though
there
are
number
teams
around
them
the

the
prospect
even
finishing

looks
slipping

change
years

david

was
appointed

seems
that
the
players
have
not
taken
his
training
methods
his
tactics
have
also
not
produce
the
best
results

because
the

team
after
struggling
score
goals
for
regular

this
combined
with
the
defensive
fragilities

have
been
working
the

think
have
been
unlucky
some
games
maybe
that
why
since
you
lose
one
game
you
lose
bit
confidence
think
will
work
the

and
you
just
have

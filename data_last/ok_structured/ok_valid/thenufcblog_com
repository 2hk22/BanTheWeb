the
dreaded
january
window
when
was
about
eight
years
old
fell
over
playing
football
the
street
for
the
record
really
were
using
jumpers
for
goalposts
marvellous
isn
now
all
these
years
later
can
remind
myself
that
moment
whenever
want
simply
looking
the
big
scar
kneecap
can
look
see
that
scar
and
accept
that
happened
nearly
thirty
years
ago
the
scar
little
reminder
souvenir
you
like
what
that
scar
reminds
that
you
going
play
football
gravelly

you
hit

doesn

stop
using
knee
some
sort
storytelling

although
absolutely
reserve

right

again
the
future
approach
the
january
transfer
window
beginning
recognise
the
sort
typical
grumblings
certain

newcastle
fans
that
seem
happen
every

around
this
time
selling

just
you
watch
ashley
will
sell

this
good
run

won

anyone
january
more
likely
sell
krul
cabaye
and
tiote
the
same
every
january
always
sell
cabaye
january
and
bet
again
this
year
prepared
accept
that
the
last
one
might
slip
the
tongue
but
did
hear
someone
say
and
therefore
qualifies
for
mention
knee
journal
seem
have
acquired
this
reputation
being
club
that
sees
every
january
opportunity
shoot
itself
the
foot
club
that
sees
promising
start
the
season
chance
offload
few
top
players
and
cash
while
the
going
good
even
though
wreck
our
prospects
strong
league
finish
every
year
this
gets
mentioned
and
every
year
left
bewildered
why
people
start
thinking
this
way
mike
ashley
has
been
running
this
club
for
six
january
transfer
windows
now
that
time
sold
four
senior
players
whilst
signing
them
given
zogbia
left
the
club
hurtled
trapdoor
wards
demba
left
the
start
this
year
when
were
powerless
stop
him
due
the
clause
his
contract
the
only
other
major
january
departure
mike
ashley
reign
when
sold
andy
carroll
for
some
reason
the
utter
shock
that
news
seems
continue
leave
some
our
fans
traumatised
the
scar
there
there
the
scar
reference
seems
serve
only
reminder
how
bad
felt
the
time
lose
carroll
the
extent
that
people
seem
determined
see
positives
and
search
for
reasons
pessimistic
every
turn
why
not
dwell
all
the
great
great
things
come
out
our
januarys
under
mike
ashley
first
things
first
got
thirty
five
million
quid
for
striker
who
has
subsequently
gone
score
league
goals
league
games
signed
the
likes
nolan
ryan
taylor
lovenkrands
simpson
williamson
ben
arfa
and
cisse
january
was
even
the
month
when
got
experience
the
gleeful
joy
seeing
geremi
and
xisco
leave
the
club
january
last
year
even
seems
have
become
tarnished
the
eyes
some
signed
five
frenchmen
they
didn
settle
instantly
and
result
our
relegation
scrap
went
the
penultimate
weekend
the
season
matter
that
four
them
have
played
huge
part
what
has
been
fantastic
recent
run
form
let
condemn
them
for
being
signed
the
middle
bad
season
this
season
has
been
much
much
better
far
than
any
can
have
expected
mike
ashley
may
have
made
some
decisions
his
nufc
tenure
that
range
from
weird
disastrous
but
history
has
shown
that
january
seems
bring
out
his
best
side
also
been
great
season
for
alan
pardew
far
tactically
made
huge
huge
progress
from
the
struggles
showing
more
flexibility
the
substitutions
are
better
and
the
likes
sissoko
and
anita
are
really
being
played
their
strengths
let
give
praise
where
due
let
not
pounce
pardew
saying
might
not
sign
anyone
january
may
well
sign
someone
january
all
doing
there
playing
his
cards
close
his
chest
other
managers
also
maybe
sign
one
next
month
maybe
will
sell
star
player
the
grumblers
are
forever
insisting
will
maybe
sell
cabaye
just
like
did
last
january
and
probably
will
next
year
too
however
maybe
enjoy
this
fantastic
run
form
whole
lot
more
just
relax
bit
enjoy
the
football
and
approach
january
with
bit
optimism
history
tells
perhaps
ought
don
let
people
tell
you
this
the
most
wonderful
time
the
year

accept
yourself
newcastle
enters
the
christmas
period
strange
calm
has
lowered
over
tyneside
registering
four
consecutive
wins
would
typically
arouse
the
kind
giddy
excitement
and
anticipation
expected
only
for
christmas
day
itself
but
while
various
paper
based
outlets
are
poking
thoughts
another
european
campaign
the
caution
amongst
supporters
more
palpable
any
given
man
who
enjoys
cautious
bet
soccer
would
have
taken
the
quartet
league
fixtures
falling
from
desperately
lacking
loss
sunderland
seven
points
best
many
viewing
that
optimistic
prospect
itself
however
the
bizarrely
erratic
performances
stretching
from
august
have
settled
sharply
smoother
more
disciplined
format
where
grinding
out
results
has
been
the
order
the
day
whether
design
accident
the
strategy
has
concluded
round
fixtures
with
healthy
points
tally
and
healthy
squad
take
into
the
fast
flowing
christmas
period
although
players
and
management
alike
deserve
plaudits
for
this
some
individually
and
collectively
the
period
has
also
benefited
richly
from
fortunate
circumstance
needed
when
attempting
build
form
something
that
deserted
nufc
for
pretty
much
the
entirety
the
season
previous
indeed
may
the
events
last
season
still
fresh
the
mind
that
have
kept
attitudes
cautious
perhaps
that
despite
the
comfort
points
tally
better
than
the
reigning
champions
after
third
the
season
the
football
played
hasn
been
exactly
been
emphatic
goal
difference
the
lowest
comfortable
margin
all
other
teams
positive
figures
the
problems
scoring
goals
may
have
been
mostly
solved
loic
remy
but
frequently
conceding
them
remains
issue
that
should
not
ignored
even
the
results
are
favourable
and
why
not
should
constructive
criticism
winning
side
denied
simply
because
the
result
was
pts
the
win
tottenham
could
still
fully
enjoyed
with
frank
and
brutal
assessment
once
the
day
had
past
why
tim
krul
had
many
saves
make
whilst
equally
appreciating
the
cutting
counter
attacks
made
the
first
period
that
lead
the
winning
goal
without
honest
appraisals
wins
well
defeats
restrict
ourselves
most
half
what
could
learn
and
even
the
there
nothing
gained
opposition
simply
too
good
for
bad
day
the
office
least
the
exercise
review
has
been
conducted
with
proactive
intent
mind
even
with
this
mentality
however
there
obviously
limit
what
this
squad
can
achieve
realistically
the
argument
that
our
day
can
take
any
team
home
has
weight
although
can
misleading
terms
ability
when
considering
the
same
boost
motivation
and
effort
what
facilitates
cup
upsets
however
with
the
team
now
looking
far
more
settled
and
solid
not
spectacular
alan
pardew
has
platform
build
from
with
january
approaching
and
patches
the
team
some
very
real
ability
the
system
stuck
with
recently
may
tied
together
somewhat
loosely
relying
the
fitness
shola
ameobi
and
the
improvisation
sissoko
and
gouffran
wingers
but
the
important
fact
system
that
working
with
more
consistency
than
has
been
seen
late
pardew
has
made
secret
his
preference
play
and
although
this
stubbornness
has
caused
problems
before
now
his
perfect
time
take
the
successes
our
recently
starting
and
buying
the
correct
players
improve
this
may
mean
sacrificing
assets
such
papiss
cisse
and
hatem
ben
arfa
who
would
very
likely
move
play
well
elsewhere
and
the
latter
case
very
unpopular
but
best
for
the
club
the
finances
were
properly
invested
big
ultimately
genuine
rather
than
accidental

more
likely
come
down
the
willingness
mike

qualifiers

roy

from
the

certainly
hasn

rousing
optimism
but
the
wise

has
far

within
him
that
credited
his
call
ups
previously
unselected
players
such
ricky
lambert

been

with
the
standard
cynicism

made
refreshing
not

break
from
the

both

that
greeted
their

inclusions
the
trend
has
continued
with
recent
and
deserved
additions
adam
lallana
and
jay
rodriguez
however
their
inclusion
playing
side
will
required
give
long
term
belief
that
england
will
genuinely
selected
upon
form
and
future
players
not
called
upon
simply
fill
the
squad
numbers
the
quality
entertainment
wembley
mainly
has
also
risen
the
draw
ukraine
was
the
only
game
england
had
failed
score
since
exiting
euro
games
ago
games
which
have
seen
whopping
goals
scored
the
cynic
may
point
routine
wins
over
minnows
such
san
marino
but
would
disingenuous
say
the
games
brazil
sweden
and
scotland
were
not
good
value
entertainment
regardless
end
result
roy
hodgson
should
pains
extrapolate
this
small
spark
this
glimmer
entertainment
fun
that
has
dried
with
following
the
national

recent

england

paper
gave
another

yet
this
comes
back
original
point
was
pardew
introducing
goalscoring
threat
was
effectively
reducing
ten
men
for
the
whole
the
second
half
you
take
that
view
then
you
have
praise
the
man
for
his
charitable

life
reduced
nine

shortly
after
the
equaliser
replacing
remy
with

bringing
papiss
cisse
pardew
unfortunately
for
wasn
introducing
the
sparkling
livewire
who
scored
his
first
games
for
was
introducing
the
increasingly
forlorn
desperate
liability
who
has
now
gone
months
since
last
scored
league
goal
much
has
been
said
before
about
the
reasons
behind
cisse
decline
and

too
instinctive
player
all
about

spur
the
moment

the

then
has
shown
himself

force
himself
back
into
form
going
for
outrageous
spectacular
efforts
worked
home
southampton
last
season
but
that
strike
was
one
among
many
such
efforts
this
isn
what
you
want
your
number
doing
course
his
main
role
cutting
edge
not
produce
screamers
per
year
his

total
last

the
fact
that
managed

when

away
from

cast
your

back
please
january
fresh
from
injection
lorryload
french
players
arrived
villa
park
with
renewed
confidence
and
suddenly
produced
much
improved
performance
alongside
badly
needed
victory
papiss
cisse
scored
significant
goal
that
pivotal
evening
wasn
his
last
league
goal
for
managed
more
since
then
more
since
the
end
january
but
this
goal
wasn
just
significant
for
cisse
much
was
for
the
whole
team
because
that
opening
goal
villa
park
was
the
last
time
the
premier
league
scored
perhaps
the
most
basic
goals
the
through
ball
from
midfield
put
the
striker
clean
through
goal
league
and
cup
games
later
and
haven
managed
score
even
one
goal
that
type
much
has
been
made
our
lack
goals
direct
from
corners
recent
years
but
for
this
stat
much
greater
concern
corners
are
fairly
straightforward
affair
with
element
lottery
them
could
doing
better
course
but
tactics
shouldn
built
around
set
pieces
however
the
thought
that
games
since
that
night
villa
park
haven
once
managed
play
striker
behind
the
defence
score
real
worry
and
perhaps
big
factor
any
cisse
decline
that
threaded
through
ball
from
central
midfield
just
isn
happening
cisse
plays
way
very
reminiscent
how
andy
cole
once
did
for
his

like

his

and

one
step
ahead
him
cisse
simply
cannot
operate
our
current
system
fact
going
back
that
grim
defeat
sunderland
worries
that
are
fundamentally
lacking
terms
the
variety
threats
are
able
offer
don
score
from
corners
this
known
fact
effectively
play
without
direct
wingers
aerial
threat
front
crosses
from
wide
positions
aren
option
and
seemingly
aren
set
play
incisive
through
balls
for
striker
run
onto
our
attack
open
play
becomingly
increasingly
restricted
someone
cutting
from
either
flank
and
taking
shot
themselves
firing
low
chipped
cross
the
centre
the
only
alternative
that
seems
spectacular
long
range
effort
piece
skill
from
cabaye
ben
arfa
the
obvious
problem
here
that
become
restricted
one
two
channels
attack
then
become
predictable
and
therefore
easy
defend
against
already
seeing
teams
frequently
doubling
ben
arfa
and
remy
and
nullifying
almost
completely
setting
all
rivalry
aside
sunderland
have
proven
all
season
quite
limited
defensively
and
yet
never
once
got
the
opportunity
run
behind
them
feasibly
personnel
issue
pardew
spent
most
the
first
half
sunderland
switching
players
around
rotating
the
attacking
players
trying
find
magic
formula
bring
about
breakthrough
yet
cisse
exactly
the
sort
player
thrive
that
kind
opening
simply
isn
being
given
them
work
with
the
team
seems
entirely
geared
working
the
ball
out
the
inside
left
right
channels
fortunate
that
have
people
like
remy
ben
arfa
and
cabaye
who
are
capable
the
occasional
piece
brilliance
overcome
such
predictability
but
they
have
off
day
which
they
are
more
than
capable
then
there
literally
nothing
else
happening
just
sedate
toothless
passing
the
central
third
the
pitch
with
movement
and
incision
scored
plenty
goals
this
season
appreciate
this
doesn
really
appear
major
issue
but
predictability
something
that
opponents
quickly
work
out
and
pardew
plan
bring
shola
and
direct
then
may
well
give
now
pardew
and
perhaps
the
players
need
learn
that
going
central
doesn
have
mean
going
long
remy
and
ben
arfa
can
create
space
wide
areas
they
can
central
areas
and
that
can
bring
cisse
back
life

pay
very

however
when
take

the

that
some

here
would
like
think
expect

the

hinge
these

nowadays
however
when

looking

have
won
nothing
for
long

the
sheer
importance
local
bragging

there
for
all
see
our
rivalry
times
feels
like
all
have
yes
for
spells
the
last
years
occasionally
tarted
ourselves
bit
competed
with
the
big
boys
swanned
around
europe
while
sunderland
played
their
spurned
lover
role
perfection
shrieking
like
bairns
while
had
the
nerve
look
beyond
the
confines
the
north
east
and
attempted
win
real
trophy
not
the
fabled
north

top

trophy
that
has
halley
comet
like

appearing
only
the
rare
occasions

finish
above
but
there
denying
are
now
both
very
much
back
mode
two
teams
with

winning
anything
preparing
lock
horns
like

three
legged
elderly
stags
and
that
not
metaphor
use
lightly
often
anyway
digress
apologise
here
wittering
about
newcastle
and
sunderland
when
this
was
supposed
depth
session
psychological
self
analysis
decided
address
hatred
and
fear
the
derby
game
need
use
logic
and
rock
solid
statistical
proof
reassure
myself
that
this
fixture
not
dreaded
paper
are
better
than
them
all
over
the
pitch
scoring
goals
and
got
some
excellent
attacking
players
good
form
they
got
incredibly
slow
defence
tempted
compare
them
collection
three
legged
elderly
stags
hadn
used
that
metaphor
already
terrible
form
that
would
appear
there
for
the
taking
recent
history
very
much
our
side
won
the
last
derby
games
they
won
the
fact
that
they
won
the
last
one
means
that
they
had
their
blip
fluke
for
the
time
being
and
another
one
isn
due
for
good
years
they
have
new
manager
place
discovered
back
april
the
new
manager
bounce
something
wary
however
given
that
gus
poyet
literally
lost
his
previous
job
for
allegedly
shitting
the
opposition
dressing
room
surprised
they
experience
another
such
bounce
would
anyone
their
right
mind
seriously
encourage
any
bounce
related
behaviour
from
someone
when
there
such
obvious
risk
for
want
better
term
splatter
impact
similarly
distasteful
note
have
the
prospect
the
home
fans
consider
here
the
cauldron
noise
the
fervent
atmosphere
whipped
sunderland
fans
could
intimidate
our
fragrant
delicate
continental
players
and
put
them
off
their
game
fact
they
have
set
fans
dispirited
their
dismal
start
the
season
that
there
are
still
tickets
available
for
the
game
this
usually
their
only
sell
out
any
season
clearly
looking
deep
despair
here
when
arrived
similar
circumstances
and
cuffed
them
the
speed
with
which
they
collectively
gave
and
walked
out
suggests
only
early
goal
away
from
silencing
them
sunday
allowing
enjoy
the
atmosphere
home
game
our
fans
make
all
the
noise
all
the
statistics
are
our
favour
there
should
nothing
fear
and
yet
still
dreading
which
probably
demonstrates
that
you
can
never
prove

trial
same
result
three
years
ago
don
always
swim
meters
straight
the
pool
but
when
you
can
bet
going
time
today
lunch
stared
the
wide
open
empty
lane
front
and
said
let
see
what
got
the
splits
was
continuous
swim
but
managed
split
the
stop
watch
every
mtotal
distancetotal
timecumulative
pace
mnote
felt
good
bilateral
breathing
didn
out
too
hard
whoa
pretty
much
exact
same
split
surprising
this
was
mostly
breathing
the
right
going
and
the
left
coming
down
interesting
didn
fall
off
that
much
felt
more
tired
for
sure
flip
turns
and
push
offs
were
weak
very
odd
that
this
exactly
the
same
time
had
the
last
time
timed
swim
december
somewhat
reassuring
see
that
splits
were
much
more
even
this
time
around
that
last
may
have
taken
years
triathlon
training
but
think
starting
get
the
hang
proper
pacing

days
cycling

one
was
from
kawaihae
hawi
and
back
and
then
waikoloa
road
and
back
total
kms
this
was
the
most
scenic
part
the
bike
ride
the
ocean
scenery
was
spectacular
whales
constantly
jumping
about
also
this
the
hilliest
part
not
nasty
hilly
just
constant
and
down
and
also
the
windiest
but
definitely
nasty
windy
cross
winds
particularly
nearly
got
blown
over
few
times
the
turnaround
hawi
day
cycling
was
from
kona
along
the
queen
waikoloa
road
and
back
this
the
lava
fields
part
the
ride
you
got
chunky
lava
the
start
and
then
the
nice
smooth
ropey
lava
near
the
end
and
this
pretty
much
what
looks
like
from
the
airport
the
turnaround
taking
cliff
bar
the
lava
went
around
the
island
hilo
one
day
not
much
going
there

steaming
and
venting
all
around
the
crater
awesome
trip

risk
going

very
top
but
were
still
high
above

vantage
point
for
the

frozen
sole
not
sure
how
was
able
sneak
this
one
take
though
this
month
strategy
was
start
moderate
pace
and
try
hold
steady
for
long
possible
and
then
bury
myself
the
end
kind
worked
didn
have
anything
left
for
the
bury
the
end
part
temp
was
but
warmed
during
the
run
there
was

and
was

sunday

frozen
sole
award
winning
run
sort
plan
the
plan
this
week
was
take
easy
for
the
first
kilometer
ease
into
the
second
ratchet
things
the
middle
and
hammer
the
end
went
according
plan
was
control
and
let
the
group
wanted
finish
with
ahead
planned
reel
them
and
pass
them
around
mark
was
pretty
good
felt
fine
but
should
have
gone
faster
actually
these
were
mostly
into
the
wind
and
was
feeling
pretty
out
shape
for
these
splits
was
good
and
passed
least
one
the
people
wanted
was
too
slow
thought
was
faster
but
couldn
any
faster
unable
bridge
the
gap
the
runners
wanted
finish
with
although
was
fastest
didn
have
anything
else
left
was
hoping
could
have
gone
closer
minutes
final
time
was
minute
and
seconds
slower
than
last
month
wind
fatness
strangely
still
faster
than
last
year
though
custom
knit
triathlon
toque
yet
despite
all
that
was
award
winning
run
was
random
number
and
thus
the
winner
the
highly
coveted
custom
knit
triathlon
toque
pretty
snazzy
even
snazzier
that
guylaine
wanted
way
more
badly
than
did
easy

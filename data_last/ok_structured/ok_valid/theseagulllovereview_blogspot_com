policing
homophobia
the
albion
update
last
year
wrote
brief
piece
about
how
sussex
police
appeared
have
changed
their
attitude
towards
the
prosecution
homophobic
offences
the
amex
appears
now
after
the
brentford
game
january
that
perhaps
that
has
changed
again
albion
supporter
the
south
west
stand
was
aware
repeated
homophobic
gestures
made
the
brighton
fans
and
had
the
presence
mind
not
just
notify
the
stewards
but
take
photos
and
according
their
messages
twitter
video
the
event
they
also
commented
that
there
were
children
the
area
witnessing
the
abuse
the
two
photos
posted
twitter
are
reproduced
here
according
the
twitter
feed
the
albion
link
officer
sussex
police
the
individual
concerned
was
interviewed
and
dealt
with
custody
queried
what
dealt
with
meant
and
then
reminded
myself
what
the
current
police
crown
prosecution
service
and
standards
are
this
area
the
first
document
found
was
from
the
crown
prosecution
service
and
was
issued
conjunction
with
the
police
the
stonewall
and
kick
out
clearly
states
there
room
the
eyes
the
law
for
racist
homophobic
abuse
the
pitch
the
stands
the
second
document
went
was
the
prosecution
policy
for
football
related
offences
again
issued
the
crown
prosecution
service
this
document
clearly
states
there
will
presumption
prosecution
whenever
there
sufficient
evidence
bring
offenders
before
court
appropriate
criminal
charges
and
where
the
line
between
humour
and
offensive
behaviour
crossed
then
positive
action
will
taken
was
therefore
surprised
find
that
despite
the
clear
evidence
prove
what
had
happened
and
despite
the
policy
changes
and
messages
robust
action
dealt
with
meant
that
the
outcome
this
individual
banter
was
section
public
order
fixed
penalty
fine
usually
fine
this
was
according
sussex
police
considered
the
most
appropriate
punishment
based
upon
the
individual
criminal
history
nfd
and
whether
they
admitted
the
offence
nfd
the
guidance
section
offences
claims
that
these
penalties
are
used
when
low
level
anti
social
and
nuisance
offending
has
occurred
also
used
the
discretion
constable
and
does
not
require
referral
the
crown
prosecution
service
thereby
rendering
the
cps
entirely
ignorant
what
has
taken
place
and
unable
use
their
own
policy
prosecute
homophobic
abuse
per
the
terms
their
own
agreement
with
the
police
other
words
sussex
police
exercised
their
discretion
and
decided
that
this
offence
wasn
serious
enough
notify
the
cps
allow
them
consider
whether
they
should
prosecute
the
offender
and
presumably
without
any
reference
those
who
felt
offended
report
the
event
the
first
place
exactly
kick
out
and
football
homophobia
are
encouraging
the
battle
remove
racism
has
come
long
way
and
the
brentford
supporter
had
been
using
racially
offensive
language
would
sussex
police
have
used
the
same
discretion
don
know
but
doubt
sussex
police
continue
exercise
their
own
judgement
not
referring
homophobia
the
crown
prosecution
service
then
the
assumptions
about
the
attitudes
held
the
decision
makers
sussex
police
will
start
become
uncomfortable

until

primarily
defend
the

accompanied
story
about
the
cost
taking
kids
football
most
notably
pay
for
them
mascots
the
tone
how
outrageous
that
some
top
flight
clubs
should
charge
west
ham
for
children
mascots
bit
hard
the
scum
the
using
their
photo
honest
their
mascot
packages
can
cost
little
amongst
the
cheaper
those
who
charge
kids
the
top
flight
and
certainly
below
the
level
the
albion
cheapest
package
some
the
bigger
top
flight
teams
don
charge
for
mascots
all
this
not
new
news
albion
circles
fact
some
point
during
our
odd
issues
around
words
complained
bitterly
about
how
albion
charge
mascots
but
such
con
albion
offer
two
mascots
each
home
match
the
chance
hold
player
hand
for
free
they
are
chosen
random
from
the
club
database
seagull
club
youfs
and
unfortunately
that
doesn
include
year
old
one
lucky
kid
also
gets
picked
random
represent
the
club
away
matches
for
free
too
this
chosen
from
whoever
has
booked
away
ticket
and
has
joined
the
seagull
club
for
free
and
seagull
club
membership
guarantees
wealth
luxuries
including
free
replica
shirt
your
seventh
birthday
but
then
get
into
the
pricing
any
other
mascots
for
home
matches
are
available
priced
from
and
for
the
captain
package
for
chance
get
near
gordon
greer
package
doesn
sound
too
bad
seriously
though
the
commercialisation
being
club
mascot
new
thing
but
doesn
necessarily
mean
bad
thing
sure
was
lucky
enough
free
mascot
hartlepool
away
was
magical
moment
for
warming
with
john
byrne
will
forever
etched
memory
and
there
were
disappointments
was
meant
given
away
strip
that
famous
chewit
wrapper
inspired
wonder
but
the
club
had
run
out
them
size
that
point
the
season
was
however
wonderful
experience
especially
when
won
the
toss
little
self
indulgent
contribution
the
cause
was
all
won
that
day
and
pretty
much
all
that
season
these
rose
tinted
nostalgic
football
moments
yesteryear
that
means
collectively
despair
change
and
especially
the
monetisation
things
like
mascots
but
clubs
must
profit
driven
keep
with
ridiculously
expensive
wage
levels
week
for

anyone

excellent
new

why

that
some
the

the

don

that

are

the
first
time

back
our
monochrome

april
the
fanzine
second
season
tslr
spoke
the
telford
tiger
after
had
just
been
awarded
our
coveted
player
the
season
prize
that
interview
replicated
below
for
your
general
amusement
should
noted
that
one
our
favourite
tslrites
fragglemiller
had
the
pleasure
meeting
bennett
you
tslr
player
the
season
this
the
greatest
moment
your
life
yeah
one
them
good
achievement
didn
even
know
thank
you
you
know
you
won
any
other
awards
this
season
yet
not
this
season
but
won
young
player
the
year
wolves
two
seasons
ago
and
then
won
young
player
the
season
bury
when
was
loan
last
year
does
feel
like
long
way
from
the
dark
days
the
start
the
season
when
you
first
arrived
yeah
definitely
everything
changed
lot
the
new
gaffer
come
and
really
stamped
way
football
wants
play
starting
play
that
way
now
the
fans
seem
enjoying
the
style
football
playing
and
hopefully
can
get
the
three
points
need
against
carlisle
now
safe
the
training
ground
poyet
first
session
several
players
said
they
could
see
the
impact
had
straight
away
was
that
true
for
you
definitely
obviously
watched
few
games
before
got
the
job
and
found
out
what
needed
get
better
weren
defending
well
team
all
how
does
that
translate
terms
training
sessions
training
just
training
really
but
think
instilled
more
confidence
the
boys
pass
the
ball
each
other
and
not
afraid
someone
marked
give
them
just
knowing
your
players
really
some
players
are
technically
better
than
others
you
certain
situations
you
can
give
them
after
the
game
monday
hartlepool
chris
turner
said
play
continental
style
are
poyet
methods
very
different
the
ones
you
experienced
the
english
game
yeah
with
lot
the
training
sessions
experienced
all
and
you
can
take
many
touches
you
want
you
know
very
rare
that
the
gaffer
asks
you
play
three
touch
football
that
encourages
you
pass
the
ball
and
move
create
angle
get
the
ball
back
you
were
signed
russell
slade
who
presumably
didn
sell
the
club
you
passing
game
and
total
football
just
said
that
wanted
come
and
play
been
loan
for
year
and
half
with
crewe
just
needed
break
away
and
become
own
person
been
there
all
that
time
young
lad
and
needed
become
man
think
was
miles
away
from
breaking
into
the
first
team
there
pre
season
knew
wasn
going
play
but
didn
feel
detached
just
focussed
staying
professional
not
causing
trouble
about
the
place
and
staying
fit
for
loan
permanent
move
could
take
when
came
didn
think
play
many
games
have
done
honest
but
russell
said
that
play
some
games
and
obviously
delighted
have
played
many
have
had
move
away
from
what
known
completely
new
place
had
grow
and
off
the
pitch
helped
personally
what
you
remember
about
poyet
first
game
charge
southampton
that
was
the
first
game
where
saw
you
really
playing
defensively
and
helping
double
mark
men
was
bit
different
but
played
right
back
before
gus
came
with
russell
slade
played
half
game
when
had
someone
sent
off
against
stockport
don
mind
doing
fair
share
defending
but
the
southampton
game
was
weird
one
for
because
was
one
those
games
where
were
the
telly
and
had
family
and
friends
watching
you
want
show
what
you
can
was
weird
really
because
hadn
had
much
time
with
gus
that
was
bit
strange
just
told
and
play
that
what
done
all
season
confident
really
worked
because
some
players
weren
feeling
confident
before
games
had
been
quite
heavy
time
for
you
all
before
that
with
the
end
russell
slade
time
here
was
just
disappointing
the
last
game
was
here
battered
hartlepool
but
didn
win
that
the
way
was
happening
gus
has
come
and
that
what
changed
score
goal
and
two
keep
going
did
you
have
lack
confidence
before
russell
slade
left
personally
didn
try
stay
confident
can
when
you
lose
that
you
struggling
think
was
more
that
team
were
thinking
team
scores
not
getting
back
obviously
that
not
good
way
think
but
that
was
the
sort
mentality
really
how
you
find
playing
with
calderon
did
you
know
anything
about
him
before
signed
very
good
top
player
never
seen
him
never
heard
him
just
seen
his
locks
coming
into
the
changing
room
had
learn
the
language
while
been
over
here
well
and
his
english
getting
lot
better
knows
the
game
played
good
level
spain
joy
watch
for
the
fans
and
joy
play
with
well
all
noticed
that
you
switch
wings
during
games
did
you
that
much
before
gus
came
not
really
but
like
the
gaffer
says
you
not
beating
your
man
one
side
and
you
both
not
getting
the
ball
just
choose
between
yourselves
gives
the
responsibility
know
when
and
when
not
change
you
looked
like
you
didn
have
celebration
for
that
goal
oldham
that
cos
don
score
very
often
when
went
didn
know
what
tried
run
around
circles
what
you
remember
about
the
charlton
game
was
great
maybe
not
our
best
performance
because
think
the
southampton
game
here
was
very
good
but
there
played
well
passed
them
off
the
park
their
place
won
the
game
scored
goals
and
they
only
scored
the
minute
think
that
was
great
day
the
fans
were
brilliant
well
you
had
pick
player
the
season
for
yourself
who
would
pick
since
gus
has
come
say
calde
but
for
the
whole
season
just
for
consistency
and
what
brings
the
team
say
crofty
people
might
say
gary
dicker
takes
people
and
looks
glamorous
the
centre
the
field
but
think
what
crofty
does
brilliant
for
the
team
keeps
the
ball
tackles
scores
goals
and
allows
others
play
well
all
the
players
were
very
confident
about
this
season
laughs
yeah
are
you
cautious
about
being
confident
for
next
season
when
you
came
here
were
still
talking
about
making
the
play
offs
not
cautious
because
think
you
should
always
confident
when
you
start
the
season
otherwise
there
point
playing
think
believe
the
brand
football
the
gaffer
wants
play
and
play
the
way
know
can
the
play
offs
and
automatic
promotion
are
not
unrealistic
all
especially
given
the
performance
against
southampton
withdean
was
top
drawer
fair
say
that
been
outclassed
few
the
top
teams
like
leeds
what
you
think
have
get
their
standard
you
think
really
approaching
that
now
think
all
about
confidence
know
keep
saying
that
but
when
they
came
here
leeds
had
been
good
run
they
were
the
top
the
league
flying
things
change
people
would
say
they
not
that
good
now
have
you
felt
kind
momentum
building
since
january
definitely
think
our
results
have
shown
that
well
haven
been
losing
many
games
and
there
steady
confidence
growing
within
the
team
for
next
season

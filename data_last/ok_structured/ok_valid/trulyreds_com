forget
the
clasico
over
spain
this
the
big
one
the
two
bitterest
rivals
the
english
game
faced
off
against
each
other
anfield
the
same
day
real
madrid
played
barcelona
separated
only
two
points
the
race
for
all
important
top
four
finish
this
was
far
the
biggest
match
the
season
far
for
both
sides
the
last
time
liverpool
tasted
defeat
the
premier
league
was
the
hands
united
back
december
then
the
hero
the
day
was
david
gea
protected
united
three
goal
lead
with
string
saves
that
cemented
his
hero
status
among
the
fans
after
the
brilliant
display
against
spurs
old
trafford
last
week
the
question
the
fan
minds
was
whether
not
louis
van
gaal
would
stick
with
the
system
that
worked
well
and
keep
juan
mata
the
side
even
though
angel
maria
was
available
after
his
suspension
all
was
revealed
when
the
starting
line
was
announced
gea
valencia
jones
smalling
blind
carrick
herrera
mata
fellaini
young
and
rooney
louis
van
gaal
entrusted
the
same
starting
side
that
demolished
spurs
the
finest
minutes
the
season
far
which
meant
immediate
return
the
team
for
angel
maria
who
started
the
bench
alongside
falcao
also
blind
was
preferred
left
back
again
place
the
returning
rojo
following
the
dutchman
sterling
display
last
weekend
subs

falcao
januzaj
valdes
pereira
united
their
white
strip
started
the
match
the
attack
and
the
first
minute
won
their
first
corner
mata
delivery
caused
confusion
the
keeper
flapped
was
bright
start
from
the
away
side
they
sought
early
advantage
quieten
down
the
home
support
fellaini
started
the
match
fiery
mood
nipping
the
heels
the
liverpool
players
great
effect
the
second
minute
the
belgian
won
the
ball
well
and
fed
rooney
but
chose
come
inside
when
the
two
united
players
behind
him
the
flank
would
have
been
the
better
option
minute
later
david
gea
was
called
into
action
saved
the
feet
sterling
ran
into
the
area
unchecked
the
defence
the
seventh
minute
juan
mata
won
the
first
free
kick
dangerous
position
and
took
himself
however
was
easily
cleared
the
upside
was
that
was
far
better
see
the
midfield
players
stepping
take
the
free
kicks
and
therefore
allow
rooney
get
the
box
where
can
the
most
damage
minutes
and
united
were
confident
mood
passing
the
ball
around
well
and
not
giving
the
opposition
time
settle
which
made
the
natives
more
restless
than
usual
mata
had
started
the
match
fine
form
and
was
unlucky
not
get
the
end
fellaini
header
after
eleven
minutes
but
couple
minutes
later
mata
was
rewarded
for
his
endeavour
scoring
goal
pure
class
happened
the
minute
following
approach
play
fellaini
who
fed
inside
pass
herrera
who
turn
saw
the
run
his
compatriot
and
slipped
the
ball
perfectly
through
mata
who
finished
comfortably
with
right
footed
shot
across
mignolet
and
into
the
far
side
the
net
what
strike
and
great
start
for
united
and
fully
deserved
great
see
manager
and
assistant
celebrating
the
goal
together
with
van
gaal
fist
pumping
then
jokingly
slapping
giggs
delight
over
the
next
few
minutes
rooney
was
unlucky
caught
offside
couple
times
the
visitors
tried
capitalise
their
possession
and
score
the
vital
second
goal
wasn
until
the
minute
that
liverpool
had
their
first
strike
when
sturridge
fired
harmlessly
wide
herrera
had
been
targeted
the
liverpool
players
for
the
roughest
treatment
and
after
twenty
minutes
joe
allen
picked
yellow
card
after
fouling
the
united
playmaker
another
free
kick
mata
was
chipped
for
fellaini
head
but
again
was
easily
cleared
the
defenders
fellaini
was
proving
handful
for
the
defenders
had
been
recent
matches
much
was
keeping
falcao
the
bench
even
the
absence
robin
van
persie
there
was
break
action
minutes
after
phil
jones
clattered
into
the
back
lallana
and
knocked
him
unceremoniously
the
ground
just
before
the
half
hour
mark
there
was
great
play
from
blind
down
the
left
almost
played
herrera
for
chance
goal
instead
won
corner
the
first
minutes
had
been
all
united
the
home
side
struggled
get
hold
the
ball
and
create
any
chances
the
biggest
cheer
from
the
home
fans
was
when
their
captain
gerrard
warmed
along
the
touchline
liverpool
wasted
great
opportunity
the
minute
when
lallana
blasted
wide
from
yards
when
truth
should
have
done
better
warning
the
united
defence
that
the
one
goal
lead
was
slender
one
united
tried
conjure
second
when
mata
and
blind
linked
but
great
effect
three
minutes
before
half
time
there
should
have
been
penalty
awarded
manchester
united
following
corner
liverpool
keeper
simon
mignolet
appeared
rather
stupidly
push
over
herrara
but
the
match
officials
obviously
didn
see
this
point
united
was
much
top
that
even
chris
smalling
tried
his
luck
with
long
run
into
the
opposing
box
but
lacked
the
quality
pass
needed
for
effort
the
stroke
half
time
carrick
let
fly
from
distance
with
fierce
drive
which
the
keeper
could
only
parry
clear
half
time
and
was
all
united
they
continued
from
the
spurs
win
with
the
same
momentum
and
were
total
control
and
passing
the
ball
around
well
herrera
and
mata
were
the
stand
out
performers
they
never
stopped
running
and
looked
for
opening
every
opportunity
the
start
the
second
half
there
were
changes
the
united
line
but
liverpool
made
substitution
bringing
their
inspirational
skipper
gerrard
into
the
play
and
the
first
thing
did
was
lunge
into
tackle
then
stamp
herrera
leg
was
the
ground
straight
red
for
gerrard
and
not
such
inspiration
after
all
really
was
awful
challenge
that
one
can
excuse
and
herrera
was
fortunate
get
and
play
quite
why
herrera
received
yellow
card
for
nearly
having
his
leg
broken
beyond
belief
couldn
have
been
any
better
for
united
play
against
ten
men
for
forty
minutes
but
the
same
with
all
teams
reduced
ten
men
liverpool
finally
started
play
thankfully
without
applying
any
real
pressure
david
gea
goal
the
main
objective
for
united
was
keep
their
cool
red
hot
atmosphere
created
the
gerrard
red
card
the
atmosphere
was
hostile
towards
the
red
devils
say
the
least
the
minute
coutinho
tried
catch
gea
unawares
with
long
range
effort
that
just
went
over
the
bar
united
needed
hammer
home
their
advantage
and
quickly
one
minute
later
louis
van
gaal
decided
bring
fresh
pair
legs
with
maria
replacing
young
who
had
had
fairly
quiet
match
that
point
phil
jones
was
booked
for
clumsy
challenge
henderson
which
could
have
had
complaints
then
happened
moment
pure
genius
the
player
the
match
the
minute
maria
picked
out
juan
mata
the
box
with
superb
chip
and
the
diminutive
spaniard
scored
goal
with
scissor
kick
the
highest
quality
with
his
left
foot
ahead
and
not
only
game
over
but
goal
the
season
decided
the
way
executed
the
goal
was
spectacular
the
hour
mark
maria
broke
pace
and
unselfishly
squared
the
ball
into
the
box
aimed
for
rooney
but
the
ball
was
agonisingly
behind
the
england
forward
mario
balotelli
entered
the
fray
and
was
immediately
booked
for
foul
jones
this
was
the
home
side
game
plan
rattle
the
united
players
with
over
aggressive
play
minutes
sturridge
managed
pull
goal
back
for
the
home
side
after
carrick
had
given
the
ball
away
with
twenty
minutes
left
all
united
had
was
hold
while
being
abused
and
off
the
pitch
free
kick
from
maria
was
punched
clear
carrick
who
then
played
the
ball
back
into
the
danger
area
where
rooney
clashed
with
henderson
skrtel
and
mignolet
but
escaped
unharmed
and
thankfully
caution
free
maria
was
guilty
giving
the
ball
away
dangerous
area
but
thankfully
harm
was
done
the
end
but
all
the
same
could
have
been
worse
united
only
had
the
one
goal
lead
united
was
struggling
make
their
extra
man
advantage
count
since
the
liverpool
goal
and
needed
defend
resolutely
while
the
same
time
regaining
their
composure
the
last
ten
minutes
you
felt
that
united
needed
grab
another
goal
liverpool
were
starting
create
chances
and
after
all
their
hard
work
would
wasted
especially
against
ten
men
the
minute
falcao
came
for
the
hard
working
herrera
which
meant
rooney
took
herrera
place
midfield
for
the
last
five
minutes
the
liverpool
keeper
mignolet
lost
the
plot
around
the
edge
his
area
nearly
gifting
united
free
strike
goal
but
somehow
got
away
with
rooney
conceded
free
kick
dangerous
area
which
was
cleared
fellaini
and
united
countered
with
falcao
down
the
left
but
his
cross
missed
everyone
minutes
the
clock
and
maria
infuriated
his
team
mates
giving
away
the
ball
far
too
easily
when
possession
was
the
requirement
into
added
time
and
united
eventually
started
keep
hold
the
ball
and
all
that
passing
paid
off
when
blind
burst
into
the
area
and
was
upended
for
penalty
emre
can
rooney
strode
and
placed
the
ball
towards
the
corner
but
mignolet
managed
save
full
stretch
surely
wouldn
matter
the
game
had
entered
last
seconds
while
everyone
concentrated
the
penalty
rojo
replaced
blind
skrtel
had
the
last
word
stamped
gea
and
should
have
seen
red
for
that
terrible
challenge
but
like
many
his
colleagues
got
away
with
gea
writhed
agony
the
referee
blew
for
full
time
united
there
better
place
for
united
win
than
anfield
and
with
the
three
points
they
have
put
some
breathing
space
between
themselves
and
liverpool
and
move
closer
arsenal
and
city
absolutely
brilliant
win
for
united
and
fully
deserved
they
were
complete
control
for
the
whole
match
many
will
say
that
gerrard
dismissal
changed
the
outcome
the
match
but
had
the
opposite
effect
liverpool
played
better
when
reduced
ten
men
you
can
take
anything
away
from
the
way
united
approached
the
match
from
the
start
they
were
the
attack
and
full
purpose
trait
rarely
seen
this
season
only
they
had
turned
the
same
style
earlier
the
season
all
the
players
put
great
team
effort
but
there
are
two
players
who
deserve
the
extra
plaudits
and
they
are
the
spanish
duo
man
the
match
juan
mata
and
ander
herrera
after
being
left
the
bench
many
times
over
this
season
they
proved
their
class
and
warranted
the
starting
place
given
them
the
manager
with
carrick
support
they
totally
overpowered
liverpool
and
didn
allow
the
home
team
get
hold
the
ball
there
will
match
next
weekend
due
the
upcoming
round
internationals
which
shame
the
break
could
disturb
the
momentum
that
united
have
built
however
positive
note
will
give
robin
van
persie
the
valuable
time
needed
recover
from
his
injury
his
goal
scoring
feats
will
needed
for
the
run

about

not
anymore
prior

was

first
the
last
ten

first
chance
goal
came
after
minute
ashley

tried
his
luck
from
outside
the
box
which
the
keeper
collected
easily
with
only
two
minutes
play
elapsed
phil

delivered
that
dreaded
back
pass
again
and
almost
put
gea
trouble
but
thankfully
the
keeper
managed
clear
for
corner
when
will
they
ever
learn
the
seventh
minute
rooney
burst
into
the
area
chasing
great
through
ball
from
young
and
pulled
the
ball
back
aiming
for
herrera
who
just
couldn
get
there
ahead
the
spurs
defender
then
minute
later
came
the
crucial
early
goal
and
what
goal
carrick
played
brilliant
through
ball
for
fellaini
who
took
his
stride
and
confidently
smashed
past
keeper
lloris
fantastic
start
united
with
sublime
pass
carrick
add
that
together
with
the
belgian
left
footed
finish
meant
that
this
was
the
perfect
start
for
the
red
devils
fact
had
been
high
tempo
start
from
all
the
team
with
the
fans
also
full
voice
this
had
been
far
the
best
start
united
game
for
long
time
with
the
team
attacking
full
confidence
and
their
passing
was
spot
again
young
was
impressive
down
the
left
and
carrick
tandem
with
herrera
controlled
everything
the
middle
the
second
goal
came
the
minute
corner
was
swept
over
mata
and
was
headed
back
into
the
danger
area
fellaini
when
was
cleared
straight
carrick
who
intelligently
lobbed
header
over
all
the
defenders
and
back
across
goal
into
the
far
side
the
net
leading
and
playing
with
determination
rarely
seen
recently
this
was
like
the
united
old
carrick
goal
was
similar
not
crucial
the
important
header
steve
bruce
against
sheffield
wednesday
all
those
years
ago
united
headed
for
their
first
premier
league
title
minutes
young
run
almost
produced
killer
pass
into
the
penalty
area
but
one
was
there
take
advantage
his
great
ball
this
time
was
one
way
traffic
spurs
had
not
even
managed
shot
target
four
minutes
later
great
cross
from
fellaini
across
the
area
almost
played
mata
but
was
just
unable
get
time
then
the
stadium
shouted
for
penalty
for
foul
mata
but
unfortunately
had
been
flagged
offside
chris
smalling
tried
bring
the
ball
forward
and
looked
like
could
all
the
way
the
opposition
box
but
the
end
his
final
pass
was
too
strong
for
rooney
mata
was
the
only
booking
the
match
for
united
after
was
cautioned
for
foul
minutes
that
the
only
blight
terrific
performance
the
home
side
the
third
goal
came
the
minute
rooney
collected
poor
pass
from
spurs
and
took
the
defenders
himself
and
once
the
box
there
was
doubt
about
the
outcome
slotted
the
ball
into
the
corner
the
net
great
individual
goal
forward
totally
top
his
game
and
what
can
say
about
the
celebration
knockout
minutes
and
again
was
fellaini
who
caused
mayhem
down
the
left
whipped
the
ball
for
rooney
who
scuffed
slightly
that
was
almost
the
fourth
goal
and
great
link
play
between
fellaini
and
his
captain
the
stroke
half
time
there
was
still
time
for
rooney
try
his
luck
from
distance
but
fired
wide
good
job
missed
doubt
could
better
his
goal
celebration
this
was
far
the
best
minutes
played
united
all
season
half
full
inventive
play
and
confidence
with
all
the
team
top
their
game
especially
rooney
and
fellaini
truly
refreshing
write
positively
about
the
side
after
their
recent
disappointments
the
hope
was
that
they
could
continue
the
same
vain
the
second
half
with
the
type
start
made
united
the
biggest
question
was
where
had
this
team
been
hiding
all
season
spurs
had
had
shots
goal
that
how
impressive
united
had
been
united
started
the
second
half
attacking
the
stretford
end
with
changes
made
van
gaal
the
minute
spurs
had
their
first
clear
attempt
goal
dembele
which
was
high
over
the
bar
rooney
was
fire
and
once
again
the
minute
tried
nod
one
down
for
fellaini
but
the
ball
deflected
back
into
his
path
the
edge
the
area
couldn
quite
wrap
his
foot
around
and
strikes
over
have
said
before
only
had
been
used
front
more
often
the
season
who
knows
where
would
have
ended
united
continued
with
their
tidy
passing
play
from
the
first
half
and
spurs
hardly
got
sniff
the
ball
and
when
they
did
united
quickly
snuffed
out
the
minute
rooney
tried
yet
again
lay
off
chance
colleague
this
time
for
blind
but
the
dutchman
dithered
little
and
the
chance
was
blocked
mason
should
have
done
better
for
spurs
minute
later
but
pulled
his
shot
well
wide
gea
goal
all
honesty
spurs
never
looked
like
scoring
even
troubling
david
gea
over
the
next
ten
minutes
united
enjoyed
period
passing
practice
they
fully
controlled
the
game
none
more
than
the
middle
the
park
with
the
trio
carrick
herrera
and
mata
impressing
the
hour
mark
blind
almost
played
herrera
goal
with
slide
rule
pass
which
was
unfortunate
not
come
off
another
blistering
run
young
down
the
left
wing
earned
united
corner
which
came
nothing
however
credit
young
has
shown
recent
matches
the
old
magic
has
returned
and
looks
like
player
who
really
enjoying
his
football
minutes
and
the
crowd
witnessed
wonderful
cross
field
pinpoint
pass
rooney
straight
fellaini
that
started
move
which
ended
with
herrera
firing
his
shot
into
the
side
netting
another
move
precision
the
reds
which
was
joy
watch
with
fifteen
minutes
left
the
clock
united
had
the
ball
the
back
the
net
but
the
flag
was
well
before
rooney
had
tucked
away
herrera
was
flagged
offside
perhaps
wrongly
after
long
ball
over
the
top
shortly
after
the
spaniard
had
effort
from
distance
which
flew
wide
after
minutes
there
was
fully
deserved
standing
ovation
for
juan
mata
left
the
pitch
replaced
youngster
pereira
was
fantastic
see
the
reception
given
mata
made
his
way
down
the
touchline
and
towards
the
tunnel
really
fan
favourite
and
put
performance
that
merited
the
applause
here
hoping
that
doesn
have
injury
problem
the
second
change
came
the
minute
when
fellaini
was
taken
off
and
falcao
was
given
another
opportunity
fellaini
another
player
who
had
played
his
socks
off
and
opened
the
scoring
with
aplomb
received
the
second
biggest
round
applause
the
day
the
minute
captain
fantastic
rooney
was
back
clearing
the
defensive
lines
spurs
tried
salvage
something
from
the
match
van
gaal
third
and
final
change
the
match
was
the
final
minutes
which
saw
rafael
come
for
the
impressive
carrick
who
had
fully
earned
his
early
rest
the
match
reached
climax
harry
kane
almost
squeezed
the
ball
into
the
net
but
david
gea
made
improvised
save
sitting
the
ball
not
his
greatest
save
but
kept
valuable
clean
sheet
disappointing
there
were
goals
the
second
half
but
that
doesn
take
anything
away
from
the
great
performance
the
team
with
goals
conceded
and
huge
morale
boosting
three
points
ahead
some
tricky
matches
ahead
spurs
were
really
poor
the
match
but
all
fairness
they
couldn
have
expected
united
play
well
they
did
today
and
think
they
were
surprised
anyone
the
way
the
home
side
came
out
the
blocks
firing
all
cylinders
would
seem
that
the
players
have
appetite
for
achievement
this
season
after
all
nine
and
the
red
devils
can
keep
the
momentum
from
this
match
then
not
only
top
four
but
dare
say
top
three
finish
the
season
definite
possibility
but
first
there
the
small
matter
trip
anfield
take
our
bitter
rivals
liverpool
repeat
today
performance
would
invaluable
the
team
confidence
for
the
run
and
fully
expect
victory
especially
with
rooney
his
current
mood

united
traveled

around

the
only

were
robin

the

the

and
that
meant
fellaini
was
and
falcao
demoted
the
bench
angel
maria
kept
his
place
even
though
has
been
out
sorts
recent
displays
and
juan
mata
was
once
again
named
substitute
within
minute
the
start
the
reds
broke
forward
through
captain
rooney
and
with
three
against
two
played
the
ball
through
the
speedy
maria
but
his
first
touch
let
him
down
and
the
move
quickly
broke
down
good
start
from
united
but
wonder
more
confident
maria
wouldn
have
wasted
such
good
opportunity
front
goal
after
quality
display
against
sunderland
ashley
young
took
his
time
finding
his
feet
the
left
and
gave
the
ball
away
couple
times
the
early
stages
the
match
sunderland
won
the
first
corner
after
five
minutes
when
maria
lost
the
ball
attack
far
too
easily
this
was
quickly
followed
another
wayward
cross
field
pass
from
the
argentinian
which
almost
set
newcastle
their
way
but
they
wasted
their
chance
the
home
side
had
good
shout
for
penalty
after
coming
together
between
smalling
and
riviere
but
referee
taylor
waved
play
big
let
off
for
smalling
who
would
have
been
serious
trouble
the
decision
had
gone
against
him
the
opening
fifteen
minutes
former
united
player
obertan
was
seeing
plenty
the
ball
probably
far
more
than
saw
when
was
old
trafford
the
minute
herrera
sliced
effort
wide
after
rooney
had
held
the
ball
well
the
penalty
area
this
point
the
match
united
were
pressing
and
through
ball
over
the
top
from
daley
blind
almost
found
rooney
the
end
but
keeper
krul
managed
get
there
first
talking
blind
been
impressed
with
his
work
rate
this
season
and
even
though
was
guilty
some
early
errors
you
can
fault
his
willingness
get
stuck
united
first
corner
didn
come
until
the
minute
and
was
taken
young
from
the
right
which
fellaini
rose
high
get
but
couldn
achieve
any
direction
power
shortly
after
there
was
some
good
combination
play
the
right
wing
between
maria
and
valencia
get
the
ball
across
but
was
too
high
even
for
fellaini
rooney
had
great
chance
put
united
ahead
the
magpie
defence
stood
still
waiting
for
offside
flag
which
didn
come
and
the
forward
collected
the
ball
from
young
touch
span
and
just
put
his
effort
out
for
goal
kick
great
chance
missed
but
least
the
reds
were
making
the
effort
the
half
hour
after
mistake
newcastle
maria
nicked
the
ball
the
left
back
and
then
played
into
rooney
who
couldn
quite
get
under
control
before
krul
gathered
another
chance
went
begging
and
looked
like
being
one
those
nights
the
first
minutes
united
were
totally
control
and
rooney
and
maria
were
the
liveliest
players
the
pitch
and
their
efforts
had
been
unfortunate
not
have
earned
goal
all
honesty
the
home
side
were
rather
dull
and
lacked
any
ambition
ideas
which
made
easier
for
united
they
did
manage
shot
the
minute
which
forward
cisse
blasted
well
wide
david
gea
goal
five
minutes
before
half
time
young
whipped
over
one
his
trademark
right
footed
crosses
which
maria
sent
back
over
from
the
right
but
one
was
there
get
the
end
then
johnny
evans
and
cisses
had
spat
literally
the
center
circle
which
they
continued
for
the
next
few
minutes
closer
inspection
they
both
had
kick
each
other
after
the
ball
had
gone
and
were
both
fortunate
not
receive
yellow
cards
worse
after
they
were
seen
exchanging
bodily
fluids
great
cross
from
valencia
the
minute
saw
fellaini
rise
the
highest
power
header
goal
wards
which
krul
palmed
out
into
the
box
where
herrera
was
waiting
pounce
but
the
ball
sailed
over
his
head
with
minute
normal
time
left
gea
got
hand
the
ball
riviere
bore
down
his
goal
fairness
the
striker
did
start
tumble
the
ground
gea
approached
but
that
takes
nothing
away
from
the
keepers
bravery
diving
the
feet
couple
players
another
area
gea
game
that
has
vastly
improved
half
time
and
all
square
united
had
played
better
than
recent
matches
and
had
managed
total
five
shots
but
due
combination
poor
finishing
and
the
keeper
krul
they
had
failed
capitalise
their
superiority
they
had
also
survived
strong
penalty
claim
from
newcastle
changes
were
made
van
gaal
the
beginning
the
second
half
united
started
brightly
and
after
two
minutes
marcos
rojo
tried
his
luck
from
distance
only
see
his
effort
just
over
the
bar
minutes
newcastle
created
their
best
chance
ball
over
the
top
beat
the
offside
trap
but
gea
came
united
rescue
yet
again
spread
himself
save
header
from
riviere
the
far
post
this
was
followed
corner
that
was
cleared
from
the
danger
area
smalling
not
for
the
first
time
this
season
united
were
living
dangerously
and
were
saved
the
outstanding
gea
then
far
united
best
chance
the
game
came
the
other
end
when
two
efforts
were
missed
the
reds
the
same
move
first
fellaini
chested
down
and
had
his
volley
saved
then
young
failed
score
from
the
rebound
rooney
did
manage
put
the
ball
the
net
the
minute
this
time
was
adjudged
offside
but
closer
inspection
was
very
close
call
chance
after
chance
came
and
went
and
seemed
all
united
needed
was
someone
with
calm
head
convert
one
them
minutes
adnan
januzaj
joined
the
action
place
very
unhappy
maria
who
could
easily
seen
mouthing
his
displeasure
under
his
breath
fair
had
played
well
certainly
better
than
against
sunderland
united
received
their
first
caution
the
minute
when
rojo
was
booked
for
upending
obertan
after
hours
play
was
proving
frustrating
evening
for
united
too
many
attacks
came
halt
for
offside
decisions
all
they
couldn
convert
possession
into
clear
cut
chances
januzaj
tried
stretch
his
legs
down
the
right
but
was
scythed
down
gutierrez
who
earned
himself
yellow
card
minutes
into
the
match
and
cisse
squandered
another
great
chance
for
newcastle
they
counter
attacked
but
pulled
his
effort
well
wide
when
should
have
done
lot
better
united
let
the
home
side
create
too
many
chances
and
needed
stamp
their
authority
the
game
and
get
the
goal
which
would
keep
the
noisy
natives
quiet
and
surely
win
the
match
after
minutes
rooney
did
well
get
above
the
defenders
meet
another
cross
ashley
young
that
almost
deceived
krul
but
managed
scramble
clear
that
was
decent
effort
rooney
who
was
looking
like
the
only
united
player
able
break
the
deadlock
jonny
evans
tried
bring
some
surprise
into
the
attack
showing
some
initiative
and
rushed
forward
with
the
ball
unchallenged
right
the
opposition
box
but
nothing
came
from
his
hard
work
least
tried
suppose
januzaj
didn
create
many
chances
from
the
right
and
began
wonder
maria
was
right
moan
about
his
earlier
substitution
the
minute
van
gaal
brought
mata
for
fellaini
who
had
been
industrious
and
had
couple
chances
but
change
united
tactics
was
needed
plus
fresh
pair
legs
for
the
last
ten
minutes
valencia
became
the
second
united
player
booked
after
being
played
into
trouble
januzaj
united
last
throw
the
dice
came
with
less
than
two
minutes
the
clock
when
michael
carrick
made
welcome
return
after
injury
replacing
rojo
then
the
last
minute
the
winner
came
send
united
fans
all
over
the
world
into
frenzy
after
great
work
from
rooney
who
chased
lost
cause
the
penalty
area
cause
confusion
the
home
defence
which
turn
made
krul
miskick
the
ball
straight
into
the
path
ashley
young
who
calmly
slotted
the
ball
over
the
line
the
obvious
relieve
van
gaal
who
sprang
out
his
seat
and
punched
the
air
delight
there
young
last
saw
the
steady
head
needed
win
the
match
that
was
ashley
young
first
goal
since
his
effort
against
cardiff
city
january
and
didn
choose
the
right
time
come
with
the
winner
and
deserves
the
accolades
has
been
exceptional
this
season
course
united
kept
the
edge
our
seats
almost
conceding
equaliser
from
the
restart
but
that
man
gea
was
there
again
save
united
with
great
stop
his
near
post
even
though
young
scored
the
winner
there
doubt
who
won
the
match
with
his
pressing
the
defence
the
build
the
goal
captain
rooney
his
persistence
chasing
the
ball
created
the
winning
goal
out
absolutely
nothing
was
good
lesson
never
giving
lost
cause
especially
when
you
consider
didn
even
touch
the
ball
just
kept
biting
away
the
defenders
until
they
made
the
all
important
error
keeper
david
gea
proved
yet
again
that
has
been
the
most
outstanding
player
this
season
and
the
hope
that
his
new
contract
will
signed
very
soon
high
ever
the
end
was
massive
result
for
united
who
deserved
the
points
although
newcastle
had
their
chances
the
only
worry
was
that
would
end
all
square
but
thankfully
that
wasn
the
case
and
united
came
away
with
the
three
very
valuable
points
after
other
teams
around
them
had
also
all
won
next
week
the
return
the
cup
and
the
much
anticipated
match
against
arsenal
old
trafford
the
quarter
finals
the
past
this
tie
has
produced
some
humdingers
over
the
years
and
expect
the
same
type
clash
next
monday
however
being
the
cautious
type
will
take
drab
win
for
united
and
safe
passage
into
the
semi
but
you
and
know
that
just
not
going
happen
with
united
ready
for
clash
that
will
have
our
bum
twitching
and
nerves
jangling
right
until
the
end

already
cut
the
non

then
the
junior
elite
women

guys
ahead
the
hills
were
but
the
running
sections
were
taking
their
toll
the
race
was
longer
too
than
was
used
and
emptied
the
tank
the
last
lap
and
unfortunately
hit
the
deck
twice

leg
derrygonnelly
was
the

scratch
with
the
rest
the

group
eventually
bridged
them
the
road
belcoo

all
together
the
route
turned
towards
enniskillen
and
the
roads
turned
increasingly
wet
with
the
wind
the
riders
backs
the
pace
was
blistering
but
there
were
separate
attacks
from
omaghs
paul
and
daragh
mccarter

and
raymond
dunlop
but
these
were
all
closed

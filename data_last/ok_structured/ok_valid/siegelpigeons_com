and
their
young

and
these

can

based
upon
discussions
with

these
and
reinforced
own

recommend
that
you
read
and
urge
you
take
the
following
steps
check
the
babies
for
canker
about
two
weeks
after
weaning
canker
most
common
young
newly
weaned
babies
and
can
very
serious
problem
ridzol
especially
effective
for

here

with

can
also
internal
because
can
enter
the
bird
body
through
its
navel
where
the
yolk
sac
was
attached
most
often
canker
present
our
birds
with
the
only
visible
symptom
being
slight
throat
mucous
this
causes
problems
for
many
fanciers
because
they
often
think
respiratory
problem
when
they
see
signs
throat
mucous
when
fact
what
they
are
seeing
the
early
stages
canker
generally
accepted
that
almost
all
the
current
products
use
against
canker
are
not
effective
they
once
were
going
keep
canker
under
control
must
increase
dosages
our
lofts
used
give
each
one
our
weaning
youngsters
one
pegosan
tablet
when
they
were
available
along
with
ideal
pill
took
them
from
their
parents
this
was
very
effective
weapon
against
canker
now
most
often
rely
berimax
rather
than
pegosan
and
pair
the
berimax
with
ideal
pill
giving
the
babies
canker
product
two
weeks
after
weaning
means
that
they
will
getting
the
proper
protection
from
canker
during
the
greatest
time
stress
their
young
lives
ideal
pills
are
great
idea
because
they
supply
enough
sustenance
get
the
babies
through
the
critical
first
hours
while
they
are
getting
accustomed
their
new
loft
actually
kept

nothing
but
ideal
pills
for
over
ten
days
some
fanciers
have
reported
that
the
berimax
was
not
effective
but
find
that
this
has
been
cooler
weather
when
the
birds
were
not
drinking
enough
the
approach
take
cool

double
the
berimax
dosage
and
back
the
normal
dosage
when
the
weather
warms
when
there
especially

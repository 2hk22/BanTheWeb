morning
freezing
cold
rain
lashing
down
just
the

most
sensible
folk
shiver

well
deserved
lie

foolhardy
souls
are
all
raring
putting

getting
the
kit
together
the
spray

half

and
dashing
round
town
drag

referees
flex

red

league

even
the
poor
soul
lumbered
with
unrolling
the
mud
encrusted
socks
and
gingerly
picking
out
the
sweaty
jockstraps
before
shoving
the
whole
kit
the
washing

doesn
mind
all
that
much
from
the
day

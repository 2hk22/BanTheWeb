for
the
first
four
months
this

voyaged
around

with
college
students
part
the
semester
sea
program
the
experience
traveling
with
many
young
optimistic
and
inquisitive
adventurers
was
amazing
opportunity
for
many
these
young
people
this
was
their
first
major
travel
experience
for
some
was
even
the
first
time
they
had
left
their
home
state
for
all
them
was
transformative
experience
perhaps
the
most
exciting
part
the

was
watching
these

people
metamorphose
from
novice
travelers

into

were

most
days
was

more
importantly
though
almost
daily
throughout
the
voyage
these
millennials
would
disprove
the
many
myths
associated
with
their
generation
case
point
was
their
reaction
their
immediate
disconnection
from
facebook
and
other
social

when
set

many
expected
there
major
revolt
how
could
they
possibly
survive
without

and

ironically
the
millennials
did
very
well
but
unfortunately
cannot
report

many
whom
battled

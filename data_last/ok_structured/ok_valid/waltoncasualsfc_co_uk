rather
disappointing
evening
many
fronts
following
our
mini
revival
recently
this
defeat
was
hard
swallow
godalming
took
minute
lead
when
ottley
cross
was
headed
home
stanley
started
get
into
our
stride
and
should
have
equalised
when
kristian
webb
squared
luke
roodenburg
yards
out
but
his
tame
effort
was
half
saved
aulsberry
who
then
saved
well
the
feet
michael
barima
minutes
later
kristian
webb
hooked
the
ball
goalbound
but
somehow
godalming
defender
headed
off
the
line
were
full
control
during
the
second
half
but
were
unable
make
count
against
very
nervous
home
defence
micheal
cayford
yard
drive
was
palmed
out
aulsberry
and
paul
armstrong
followed
into
the
side
netting
forced
series
corners
but
were
unable
get
clear
sight
the
goal
aulsberry
saved
well
late
when
close
range
michael
barima
bicycle
kick
was
goalbound
only

him

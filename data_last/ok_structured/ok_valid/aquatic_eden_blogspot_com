personal
soft
spot
for
rainbows

these
two
aquariums

just
incredible
these
must
very
happy
fish
looks
like
the
aquarium
owner
has
chosen
mostly
low
light
low
maintenance
plants
seems
like
good
decision
for
tank
big
the
first
one
since
trimming
that
with
lots
stem
plants
would
take
hours
note
the
mesh
over
the
top
the
aquarium
rainbows
have
tendency
jump

wednesday
march
impact
japanese
earthquake
aquarium
suppliers
ada
gallery
niigata
you
probably
heard
massive
earthquake
and
tsunami
hit
the
northeastern
coast
japan
march
since
then
group
brave
workers
the
fukushima
nuclear
power
plant
have
been
battling
explosions
and
radiation
leaks
attempt
bring
the
crippled
plant
under
control
although
may
seem
world
away
from
most
these
events
may
have
very
real
impact
our
aquascaping
hobby
many
companies
that
make
aquarium
supplies
are
based
japan
with
aqua
design
amano
and
hikari
probably
being
the
most
well
known
ada
headquartered
niigata
about
miles
from
the
worst
devastation
sendai
while
most
hikari
facilities
are
southern
japan
everyone
ada
headquarters
which
closer
the
affected
area
than
hikari
alright
the
gallery
there
sustained
little
damage
any
with
all
tanks
surviving
the
earthquake
apparently
ada
stands
and
tanks
are
designed
withstand
earthquakes
however
you
can
see
the
map
above
the
ada
gallery
and
headquarters
marked
isn
all
that
far
from
the
fukushima
nuclear
plant
that
been
leaking
radiation
for
the
last
two
weeks
since
ada
substrate
product
aqua
soil
collected
nearby
there
has
been
some
concern
over
radiation
levels
the
product
ada
was
quick
release
statement
stating
that
radiation
levels
are
being
monitored
our
national
and
local
government
monitoring
the
radiation
level
every
hour
and
not
see
any
abnormal
value
radiation
reported
from
the
area
collection
addition
that
are
not
collecting
these
soils
every
day
and
now
have
been
processing
the
soils
collected
before
the
earthquake
the
raw
materials
our
aqua
soil
series
are
collected
from
layer
earth
the
ground
and
not
see
any
concern
having
soils
contaminated
with
radiation
therefore
there
effect
radiation
all
aqua
soil
series
and
remains
ideal
substrate
for
aquarium
use
even
radiation
isn
issue
the
general
destruction
highways
and
ports
and
other
infrastructure
along
with
the
power
outages
could
delay
some
shipments
ada
products
the
you
were
planning
making
any
necessary
ada
purchases
the
near
future
and
the
products
are
stock
ahead
and
make
them
now
just
case
show
support
for
ada
and
the
japanese
people
adg
shop
offering
special
deal
aqua
soil
with
proceeds
going
the
japanese
red
cross
keep
mind
though
that
this
pre
order
and
that
the
aqua
soil
not
stock
right
now
you
are
rush
set
tank
you
may
want

when
they
expect

next

ada
gallery
niigata

also
opened
their
gallery
seven
days
week
until
further
notice
help
provide
relaxing
escape
from
the
destruction
the
international
aquatic
plant
layout
contest
iaplc
run
ada
has
not
been
impacted
delayed
though
continue
working
your
submissions
meanwhile
hikari
has
most
facilities
southern
japan
but
will
probably
also
impacted
damaged
infrastructure
and
power
shortages
there
hasn
been
lot
mention
about
the
quake
the
hikari
usa
website
but
their

waterplant
multi
function
diffuser
from
one
aquascaper
another
this
thing
amazing
tried
all
kinds
diffusers
before
from
just
sticking
the
tube
into
eheim
filter
intake
ceramic
disc
diffusors
the
tank
dedicated
powerhead
bubble
basher
all
had
some
drawbacks
whether
was
incomplete
diffusion
noise
having
have
something
ugly
the
tank
this
waterplant
diffuser
inline
diffuser
though
goes
the
outlet
inlet
tube
canister
filter
the
principle
the
same
ceramic
diffuser
but
doesn
need
clutter
the
inside
your
tank
just
pop
the
diffuser
and
tiny
bubbles
are
pushed
through
the
ceramic
cylinder
into
the
water
flow
nothing
clean
nothing
replace
efficient
quiet
and
clutter
free
also
plastic
there
glass
accidentally
break
and
fits
multiple
tube
sizes
have
mine
outlet
tubing
only
because
feel
like
putting
the
intake
would
probably
lead
burping
the
filter
still
the
diffuser
does
come
with
intake
screen
though
and
ready
put
the
end
filter
intake
directly
the
tank
there
are
some
important
things
remember
with
though
one
you
absolutely
must
have
check
valve
installed
your
line
because
the
ceramic
diffuser
works
both
ways
water
can
forced
into
the
diffuser
and
the
tube
your
pressure
gets
low
shuts
off
overnight
for
very
happy
don
have
fuss
with
suction
cups
have
ugly
tubing
tank
listen
filter
burp
all
the
time

move
timing
between
the
upper

gives
time
see

the
subtle
moves
such
the

dear
howard
the
age
was
diagnosed
with
high
blood
pressure
and
have
taken
medication
ever
since
much
older
now
friend
mine
introduced
tai
chi
and
like
many
people
struggled
the
beginning
because
there
seemed
much
learn
however
was
confident
enough
attend
day
course
was
both
excited
and
nervous
after
all
was
going
meet
the
master
you
were
not
only
helpful
and
encouraging
but
inspirational
was
hooked
and
began
take
tai
chi
far
more
seriously
the
results
revised
approach
was
that
later
the
year
blood
pressure
had
reduced
much
that
was
taken
off
one
tablet
blood
pressure
has
continued
reduce
fact
last
monday
was
taken
off
yet
another
tablet
appreciate
that
many
factors
may
influence
blood
pressure
however
convinced
that
the
improvement
blood
pressure
correlated
directly
with
involvement
chi
thank
you
for
being
you
and
helping
and
others
like
raise
our
horizons
for
personal
achievement

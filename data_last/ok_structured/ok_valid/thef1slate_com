say
that

may
just
possibly
have
made
the

mistake
michael
and
retired
too
early
having
tried
number
series
post
can
attest
the
fact
that
difficult
find
the

satisfaction
other

racing
mschumi
michael
schumacher
well
kojak
unlike
you
mark
won
have
shave
his
head
vain
effort
make
himself
interesting
attempt
musical
career
that
makes
carla

look
like
mozart
that
subject
heard
the
government
has
found
use
for
your
album
resolving
their

jacques
villeneuve
thrilled
hear
that
michael
although
never
shy
chaos

always
knew

maybe
you
could
all
gangsta
them
get
hired
careful
get
itchy
feet
and
you
end
driving
for
more
teams
than
andrea
cesaris
best
stick
with
the
tyre
degradation
machine
you
inherited
from
diresta
paul
resta
speaking
one
legend
another
michael
think
obvious
everyone
that
almost
forgeone
conclusion
that
red
bull
will
hire
existing
superstar
quick
consistent
and
media
savvy
scottish
ace
seems
apt
that
will
now
usher
what
motorsport
historians
will
refer
the
newey
resta
era
dominance
irresistible
combo
the
world
greatest
designer
and

combo
mclaren
overlooked
you

basically
said
you
hadn
snowballs

wonder
driver
steward
nigel
mansell
will
penalise
you
for
your
swelled
head
exceeding
the
max
allowed
dimensions
this
weekend
nigel
mansell
although
stranger
the
perils
not
being
able
fit

michael
you
may
recall
from
aborted
comeback
with
mclaren
which
ended
even
after
attempting
race
expensive
and
thorough
chassis
amendment
unaware
any
regulations
pertaining
the
length
width
height
drivers
head
rest
assured
that
will
leave
stone
either
turned
unturned
ensure
that
the
regulations
are
scrupulously
applied
not
applied
all
drivers
this
weekend
will
consult
not
only
the
regulations
delineated
the
fia

the
governing
body

but
also
the
interests
fairness
potential
unfairness

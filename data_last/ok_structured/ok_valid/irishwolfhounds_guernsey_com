the
torteval
irish
wolfhounds
website
which
has
been
running
since
june
has
come
the
end
its
life
set
back
those
early
internet
days
share
the
many
photographs
our
wolfhounds
had
accumulated
the
hope
that
people
who
were
interested
the
breed
would
enjoy
them
rather
than
boring
the
pants
off
family
non
wolfhound
friends
and
work
colleagues
over
the
ensuring
years
the
site
took
life
its
own
living
island
did
enabled
forge
invaluable
links
with
wolfhound
owners
around
the
world
became
forum
which
could
share
our
growing
knowledge
and
experience
with
others
the
breed
allowed
other
owners
share
their
hounds
the
near
and
far
pages
encompassed
many
tributes
beloved
wolfhounds
past
the
garden
remembrance
pages
the
two
years
during
which
our
legendary
gang
four
darcy
branigan
hogan
and
mckenna
strutted
their
stuff
across
the
world
wide
web
were
truly
magical
time
however
since
our
move
from
guernsey
gloucestershire
nearly
two
years
ago
keeping
the
site
fresh
and
regularly
updated
has
become
increasingly
onerous
this
partly
because
without
the
magnificently
photogenic
guernsey
cliff
walks
backdrops
take
far
fewer
photographs
and
partly
because
our
new
life
the
mainland
more
full
and
varied
leaving
with
less
computer
time
and
confess
less
inclination
update
the
site
has
reached
the
point
where
consciously
have
take
photographs
provide
material
and
feel
guilty
week
goes
without
new
smilebox
finding
each
new
photo
the
week
and
its
accompanying
quotation
has
become
repetitive
chore
this
not
how
was
meant
added
this
the
internet
has
become
all
encompassing
over
the
last
years
with
information
about
every
aspect
the
breed
now
widely
available
the
site
less
relevant
and
the
support
and
sharing
role
which
torteval
fulfilled
for
many
owners
has
been
taken
over
and
exceeded
facebook
personal
note
paul
and
are
new
and
exciting
stage
our
wolfhound
life
are
about
take
two
puppy
girls
just
two
months
apart
age
this
will
time
consuming
and
joyous
challenge
and
yearn
enjoy
lacey
and
doran
and
take
photographs
just
for
without
the
nagging
need
feed
the
website
constantly
the
back
mind
the
site
could
course
remain
live
but
static
just
not
updated
but
rather
than
see
become
neglected
and
dusty
the
case
with
many
its
contemporaries
prefer
discontinue
altogether
those
you
who
have
been
regular
visitors
over
the
years
thank
you
for
your
interest
your
contributions
your
support
through
many
tough
times
and
your
friendship
the
site
would
not
have
become
the
great
resource
that
undoubtedly
was
its
heyday
without
your
input
know
some
you
will
miss
your
weekly
torteval
fix
but
hope
you
will
understand
that
like
every
dog
every
website
has
natural
lifespan
time
now
put
the
torteval
website
peacefully
sleep

who

the
excellent
tour

and
the
three

abdul
the
whole
trip
ran
very
smoothly
with
only
one
very
minor
hitch
due
circumstances
outside
our
control
katie
was
tireless
her
concern
for
the
members
the
group
answered
found
the
answers
all
our
many
questions
and
made
sure
everything
ran
like
clockwork
the
drivers
were
highly
skilled
coping
with
all
the
different
difficult
conditions
ranging
from
deep
loose
sand
the
sahara
steep
hairpins
mountain
dirt
roads
and
also
managed
very
tolerant
about
our
fractured
french
when

with
them

them
ensured
the
very
smooth
running

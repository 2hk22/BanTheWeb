genuine
hopes
reaching
the

she
will
need
fully
recover
physically
from

punishing
second

tie
she
better
her
breakthrough
third
round
performance
this
year
australian
open
where
she
eventually
lost
serena

was
very
strange
match
and
was
very
and
down
said
mirza
who
playing
her
first
open
was
very
windy
today
both
were
having
problem
was
just
trying
get
rhythm
and
she
was
playing
some
good
tennis
mirza
quickly
sped
into
the
lead
behind
her
big
serve
and
forehand
and
she
reached
set
point
her
own
serve
but
she
squandered
that
with
run
poor
shots
culminating
woeful
forehand
volley
the
net
that
sailed
long
that
allowed
camerin
get
back
serve
but
the
indian
powered
down
series
big
forehands
put
the
pressure
back
and
she
converted
her
third
set
point
when
camerin
floated
forehand
long
but
the
edginess
mirza
had
shown
the
end
the
first
set
continued
manifest
itself
the
start
the
second
the
italian
broke
straight
away
for
lead
and
then
showing
more
consistency
won
four
out
the
next
five
games
level
the
tie
camerin
needed
courtside
treatment
for
injury
her
left
leg
delaying
the
start
the
decider
but
her
return
she
promptly
held
serve
and
then
broke
mirza
yet
again
take
lead
the
fizz
had
gone
out
mirza
usual
aggressive
game
but
she
rallied
the
next
game
break
love
and
get
back
serve
disputed
line
call
gave
the
indian
break
point
the
next
game
and
despite
clear
signs
that
she
was
cramping
her
legs
she
converted
that
seemed
take
the
wind
out
camerin
sails
and
with
the
crowd
getting
beind
her
mirza
served
well
she
let
two
more
break
points
slip
through
her
grasp
and
instead
paid
the
penalty
camerin
took
advantage
her
opponent
lack
mobility
breaking
back
and
levelling
but
just
when
looked
like
she
had
blown
her
chance
mirza
gave
one

this

like
anything
going
stop
her
from
going
even
higher
the
years
come

bengal
mirza
focus
during
her
early
years
was
not
always
tennis
she
began
playing
the
sport
age
six
when
her
mother
naseema
who
runs
her
own
printing
press
would
take
her
the
local
tennis
courts
during
summer
holidays
the
way
swimming
always
one
her
other
main
interests
the
young
girl
quickly
took
liking
the
sport
but
had
overcome
obstacles
from
the
beginning
mother
took
coach
who
initially
refused
coach
because
was
too
small
said
mirza
after
month
called
parents
say
never
seen
player
that
good
such
young
age
during
the
summer
mirza
would
play
several
times
week
and
began
contesting
her
first
local
tournaments
age
seven
with
few
expectations
and
little
pressure
coming
from
her
parents
who
nevertheless
supported
her
unconditionally
she
developed
keen
motivation
improve
working
hard
from
the
start
become
the
best
player
she
could
after
started
playing
just
kept
improving
said
mirza
whose
other
childhood
interests
included
dancing
studying
indian
history
and
english
which
she
speaks
fluently
never
put
pressure
myself
make
big
tennis
just
took
step
step
when
mirza
was
her
hard
work
determination
and
positive
attitude
paid
off
she
won
the
under
and
under
indian
national
championships
was
then
that
the
hard
hitting
teenager
began
taking
the
idea
making
tennis
into
career
seriously
that
was
when
really
knew
wanted
professional
player
said
mirza
who
received
her
first
sponsorship
with
adidas
soon
after
her
junior
national
titles
obviously
the
main
challenge
faced
was
financial
parents
had
struggle
first
but
when
was
years
old
got
sponsor
which
actually
still
with
today
addition
overcoming
her
financial
hurdles
mirza
would
also
have
realize
she
was
about
travel
the
road
untravelled
india
had
never
had
successful
female
tennis
player
the

the
sport

was
and
still
greatly
overshadowed
india
cricket
national
obsession

from
india
you
have
tradition
female
tennis
players

people
thought
was
stupid
said
mirza
who
grew
admiring
time

steffi
graf
however
india
not
like
every
girl

become

was
right
person

court
this
type
pressure
has
been
known
curtail

mirza
seems
comfortable
with
the
expectations
and
understands
all

the
legend
she
potentially
creating
for

something
big
the
recent
focus
mirza
has
also
helped
cultivate
greater
following
tennis
india
which
has
always
been
overshadowed
the
country
obsession
with
cricket
there
quite
bit
tennis
coverage
but
whenever
cricket
shown
the
country
comes
standstill
said
mirza
who
believes
she
were
born
boy
her
father
imran
former
cricketer
who
now
builder
would
have
probably
encouraged
her
into
the
sport
right
now
tennis
definitely
moving
but
first
there
always
cricket
cricket
tradition
that
not
going
change
there
competition
between
the
two
sports
just
want
people
know
they
can
play
other
sports
too
and
make
career
out
them
they
now
know
what
tennis

know
now
that
everything
isn
just
cricket
more
people
are
learning
how
play
tennis
and
the
sport
growing
mirza
knows
the
future
growth
tennis
india
doesn
just
depend
her
and
her
achievements
but
upcoming
crop
junior
players
that
with
her
the
public
eye
will
have
somebody
look
and
follow
however
just
years
age
mirza
the
stage
where
she
still
has
focus
her
own
career
right
now
still
young
and
the
stage
where
still
have
develop
own
game
she
said
but
whenever
kids
come
ask
for
advice
love
help
know
would
love
become
involved
with
juniors
the
future
mirza
hard
work

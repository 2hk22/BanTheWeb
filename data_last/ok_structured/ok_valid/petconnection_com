march
wasn
long
ago
that
even
the
most
well
meaning
animal
lovers
believed
the
kindest
thing
that
could
done
with
feral
cats
was
kill
them
when
started
writing
about
pets

their
care
the
early
thought
too
after
all
dead
cat
never
feels
hunger
fear
the

nor

cat
haters
and
most
all
dead
cats
never
reproduce
delivering
kittens
into
their
own

misery
skip
forward
now
and
can
truly
say
was
wrong
wrong
wrong
about
these
cats

wonderful
day
the
neighborhood
and
this
friday
the
certainly
perfect
day
for
walk
oceanside
harbor
four
kindred
spirits
dog
trainers
and
seven
dogs
walked
around
the
harbor
smelled
the
pacific
ocean
listened
waves
crashing
and
sea
gulls
squawking
and
watched
the
boats
there
wasn
cloud
the
sky
and
just
touch
breeze
ahhh
this
why
live
here
pretty
immune
the
appeal
palm
trees
but
even
the
palm
trees
were
graceful
this
morning
see
that
low
retaining
wall
bordering
the
beach
front
the
palm
trees
that
great
agility
obstacle
for
the
dogs
walk
think
riker
started
that
tradition
when
was
younger
bashir
course
had
riker
did
and
now
sisko
and
bones
are
learning
when
reach
that
part
the
walk
the
dog
must
hop
and
walk
the
length
the
wall
you
fall
another
dog
will
hop
and
take
your
place
don
fall
there
are
always
adventures
for
the
dogs
too
least
from
the
dogs
point
view
today
several
sea
lions
were
one
dock
and
big
male
barked
the
dogs
walked
past
him
bones
watched
him
closely
after
all
this
was
big
guy
who
needed
herding
dog
supervision
river
melissa
duffy
youngest
english
shepherd
also
thought
this
sea
lion
looked
sketchy
and
growled
under
her
breath
him
while
standing
shoulder
shoulder
with
several
the
older
dogs
huh
river
see
how
brave
you
are
sisko
originally
from
the
mountain
deserts
arizona
still
thinks
sea
creatures
are
really
strange
and
sea
lions
are
noisy
sisko
watched
closely
that
sea
lion
had
made
one
move
towards
would
gone
with
sisko
pushing
from
behnd
the
other
hand
would
leading
there
one
spot
our
walk
where
the
dogs
can
get
the
water
and
splash
and
all
did
except
bones
was
intent
watching
everyone
while
being
responsible
herding
dog
wait
don
out
too
deep
come
back
what
are
you
doing
meanwhile
sisko
lost
his
focus
the
sea
lion
while
jumping
from
the
dock
into
the
water
and
back
again
over
and
over
later
did
some
training
around
the
lobster
traps
did
you
know
lobster
traps
sitting
the
dock
the
sun
stink
yeah
they
stink
and
the
dogs
thought
that
the
traps
smelled
bad
enough
perhaps
they
were
for
catching
dogs
too
from
the
trainers
there
was
bit
hey
look
these
traps
have
dog
treats
woo
hoo
sniffing
the
traps
resulted
praise
and
treat
touching
the
trap
with
nose
earned
even
more
rewards
all
all
wonderful
day
lovely
harbor
good
friends
and
awesome
dogs
nothing
better
than

may
phone
conversation
with
the

vet
office
today
could
you
please
fax
harper
vaccination
records
this
boarding
kennel
receptionist
did
you
know
harper
overdue
for
her
titer
she
had
one
the
past
couple
years
receptionist
well
she
supposed
have
one
every
year
vaccinations
are
good
for
minimum
three
years
why
would
she
need
titer
every
year
receptionist
need
make
sure
her
titer
levels
aren
too
low
head
not
even
going
argue
with
you
anyway
need
you
fax
those
receptionist
you
don
want
another
titer
right
sigh
thought
they
were
trained
veterinarian
clinic
not
argue
with
about
this
stuff
maybe
she
new
was
understanding
that
pops
right
name
don
bother
arguing
with
kim
about
vaccinations
guess
they
going
argue
with
about
how
often
titers
should
done
but
seriously
not
rocket
science
the
avma
and
aaha
and
all
the
veterinary
schools
have
data
showing
that
core
vaccinations
confer
immunity
for
several
years
isn
obvious
that
titers
would
only
done
every
three
years
but
don
take
word
for
here
immunology
expert
jean
dodds
dvm
from
her
blog
response
question
about
dog
distemper
titer
being
low
suggest
titer
testing
your
dog
every
three
years
for
both
distemper
and
parvovirus
any
measurable
titer
vaccine
including
distemper
and
parvovirus
means
that
the
dog
has
specific
committed
immune
memory
cells
respond
and
afford
protection
upon
exposure
really
doesn
matter
how
high
the
titer
result
long
measures
something
get
that
vets
want
see
pets
regular
basis
think
that
important
doctor
every
year
for
physical
and
veterinarians
need
adopt
that
model
well
instead
making
stupid
reasons
that
aren
scientifically
valid

judge
panel
the
court
appeals
ruled
that
animals
are
living

but
they
are
also

and
that
doesn
trump
their
owners
constitutional

free

her

only
have
time
for
quick
post
today
but
ran
across
few
interesting
stories
that
thought
would
make
for
good
discussion
first
this
wall
street
journal
piece
david
grimm
online
news
editor
science
the
legal
status
pets
writes
until
the
early
both
animals
were
deemed
legally
worthless
that
they
didn
even
qualify
property
and
could
stolen
killed
without
repercussion
but
americans
began
spend
millions
then
billions
food
toys
and
veterinary
care
for
their
pets
the
law
changed
today
cats
and
dogs
aren
just
property
they
are
the
most
legally
protected
animals
the
country
felony
anticruelty
laws
all
states
impose
fines
and
years
prison
for
anyone
who
abuses
animals
the
federal
pets
evacuation

transportation
standards
act
passed
after
hurricane
katrina
requires

agencies

well
people
during
natural

judges
have
been
increasingly
willing
treat
cats
and
dogs
like
people
the
courtroom
allowing
custody
disputes
over
pets
and
granting
large
awards
cases
like
lohre
including
called
noneconomic
damages
typically
reserved

spouse

few
recent

cases

even
gave
dogs
their

lawyers
know
would
want
recourse
pet
were
harmed
careless
veterinarian
groomer
but
can
see
the
qualms
the
other
side
too
think
can
safely
say
all
agree
that
pets
have
value
and
more
and
more
courts
are
agreeing
well
what
your
position

within

that
being

parent
today
nobody
uses
the

owner
anymore
apparently
means
cultivating

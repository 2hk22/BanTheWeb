june
when
taste
our
wines
mentally
place
myself
the
precise
block
vineyard
from
which
the
wine
originated
october
when
alone
the
cellar
amongst
the
barrels
thief
one
hand
and
glass
the
other
can
help
but
taste
september
vineyard
nothing
without
the
soil
upon
which
rests
and
sends
its
roots
october
perhaps
nothing
defines
the
rhythms
winemaker

relentless
cadence

attempt

welcome
members
guests
back
enterprising
group
seventy
one
young
men
decided
was
high
time
for
russellville
have
its
very
own
country
club
they
had
their
eye
eighty
one
acre
parcel
just
north
town
the
will
bruce
farm
they
put
their
minds
together
and
their
names
the
dotted
line
and
collectively
pledged
get
the
development
off
the
ground
soon
thereafter
they
purchased
the
bruce
acreage
for
and
began
the
work
laying
out
the
first
nine
holes
which
today
played
the
back
referred
locally
the
bottom
the
founders
decided
borrow
complete
the
original
nine
holes
and
make
start
building
appropriate
club
house
the
membership
voted
take
bold
step
and
double
the
size
the
original
club
house
expanding
its
present
physical
layout
with
membership
and
participation
club
activities
continuing
grow
consideration
was
now
being
given
also
expanding
the
golf
course
land
just
the
hill
from
the
club
house
was
acquired
and
additional
nine
holes
were
developed
referred
locally
the
top
giving
rcc
hole
golf
course
had
taken
just
over
years
the
making
but
the
wait
was
well
worth
the
hilly
rolling
terrain
the
newly
constructed
nine
holes
played
today
the
front
was
completely
different
from
the
original
nine
holes
the
valley
floor
and
offered
scenic
vistas
that
added
much
the
aesthetic
beauty
the
entire
property
with
more
and
more
golfers
came
the
demand
for
better
golf
course
which
play
but
first
the
issue
water
had
addressed
was
with
the
addition
large
lake
the
back
serve
reservoir
shortly
thereafter
completely
new
and
modern
irrigation
system
was
installed
throughout
the
hole
layout
along
with
additional
small
lake
the
front
the
decade
the
marked
another
era
prosperity
for
the
river
valley
and
the
membership
rcc
felt
was
time
dramatically
redesign
the
entire
golf
course
the
project
was
ambitious
say
the
least
calling
for
nearly
all
the
tee
boxes
rebuilt
all
the
greens
rebuilt
and
converted
bent
grass
numerous
sand
traps
added
new
holes
constructed
and
others
modified
plus
drainage
new
sod
new
cart
paths
and
new
landscaping
and
that
wasn
enough
they
added
large
new
putting
green
and
two
way
driving
range
was
major
undertaking
and
nearly
million
dollar
project
but
you
can
see
today
the
results
are
magnificent
just
like
any
local
country
club
rcc
faces
the
everyday
challenges
operating
successful
enterprise
but
with
the
leadership
its
board
directors
the
dedication
and
commitment
its
staff
and
the
strength
its
membership
the
russellville
country
club
moves
forward
toward
its
anniversary
taking
great
pride
its
heritage
and
optimistic
outlook
for
even
brighter
future

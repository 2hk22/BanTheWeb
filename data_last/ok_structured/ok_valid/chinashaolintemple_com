the
basis
for
what
would
later
called
the

would
have
traveled

were
occasional
difficulty
the
martial
side
the
temple
most
likely
started
out

self
defense
requirements
soon
after
although
these
movements
had
been
codified
into

the
martial
arts
taught
the
shaolin
temple
china
had
spiritual
and
moral
dimension
that
was
regarded
equally
not
much
more
essential
than
the
physical
the
shaolin
monks
spent
numerous
hours
praying
and
meditating
they
did
kung

they
adhered
moral
code
which
self

was
the
only
acceptable
reason
for
fighting
and
killing

opponent
was
avoided
possible
well
liked
tales
illustrating
these
ideals
include
the
story
one
monk
who
fought

and
also
the

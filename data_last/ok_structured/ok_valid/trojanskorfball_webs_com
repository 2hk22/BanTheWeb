with
her
first
season
with
the
club
superman
chris
spice
ends
high
interview
with
chris
spicewhy
have
you
decided
retire
decided
call
day
korfball
career
for
culmination
reasons
however
the
main
one
spend
more
time
with
family
young
daughter
lara
demands
lot
attention
any
year
old
does
plus
sarah
and
are
expecting
another
child
priorities
have
changed
and
with
had
make
some
important
decisions
one
which
retire
from
playing
korfball
aside
from
the
growing
family
travelling
and
from
training
and
games
was
also
issue
well
the
fact
that
ankles
have
taken
bit
battering
over
the
years
and
the
ligaments
are
their
last
legs
like
able
walk
well
into
latter
years
when
put
all
these
issues
together
made
sense
that
the
right
thing
was
hang
boots
sum
your
time
trojans
that
such
difficult
question
answer
but
try
had
sum
time
trojans
one
word
would
unforgettable
trojans
has
given
much
over
the
years
and
owe
great
deal
the
club
and
the
people
that
belong
couldn
ever
imagine
playing
for
anyone
else
during
years
the
club
been
fortunate
enough
play
alongside
some
the
best
players
the
country
learning
much
the
process
then
there
the
brooks
family
the
brooks
family
are
amazing
how
gary
and
christine
what
they
beyond
raising
crazy
children
and
still
finding
time
pretty
much
singlehandedly
run
korfball
club
outside
working
staggering
think
safe
say
that
gary
and
christine
are
adoptive
parents
and
trojans
are
extended
family
and
always
will
best
personal
moment
trojans
whilst
been
fortunate
enough
win
some
titles
trojans
such
the
british
and
the
national
league
ekl
have
say
that
the
pinnacle
for
was
winning
the
bronze
medal
the
europa
cup
finals
poland
that
was
the
last
obstacle
for
trojans
overcome
before
could
say
that
had
won
everything
realistically
possible
english
club
korfball
worst
moment
not
being
able
play
korfball
for
years
was
definitely
the
worst
moment
playing
career
was
the
middle
what
should
been
prime
was
devastating
told
that
you
couldn
play
for
months
fortunately
hunger
for
the
sport
remained
and
was
able
banish
and
overcome
some
demons
the
process
and
come
back
stronger
person
and
player
both
mentally
and
physically
advice
for
young
player
looking
make
success
themselves
dedicated
disciplined
and
focused
and
above
all
prepared
work
hard
every
training
session
you
every
game
that
you
play
make
sure
you
learn
like
sponge
absorb
and
retain
you
want
something
bad
enough
you
can
achieve
you
just
have
believe
yourself
and
put
the
effort
like
finish
off
saying
big
thank
you
everyone
who
has
helped
throughout
playing
career
from
teammates
coaches
supporting
staff
and
the
loyal
trojanites
who
always
turn
cheer
the
team
leave
the
club
good
shape
with
the
capabilities
and
potential
and
win
even
more
titles
lastly
and
means
least
want
say
thank
you
wonderful
wife
sarah
who
has
always
been
there
for
both
the
pitch
and
off
she
brings
out
the
best
and
without
her
would
half
the
man
that
today
this
not
the
end
will
still
around
the
korfball
scene
from
time
time
however
just
not
playing

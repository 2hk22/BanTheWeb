pleasant
surprises
july
wasn
surprised
that
the
barbecue
was
top
notch
fiorella
jack
stack
barbecue
when
stopped
for
dinner
relatively
unplanned
trip
kansas
city
this
weekend
heard
good
things
about
and
were
not
disappointed
the
service
and
food
were
both
great
the
martin
city
location
hit
for
little
chow
what
surprised
was
the
waitress
response
the
what
you
have
for
beer
tossed
her
sat
down
the
patio
await
table
what
she
said
have
boulevard
wheat
boulevard
dry
stout
boulevard
pale
ale
boulevard
fill
coupla
blanks
forget
what
all
she
said
and
then
afterthought
and
have
bud
bud
light
and
all
too
often
the
wait
staff
lists
the
beers
with
the
craft
beer
relegated
the
role
afterthought
was
impressed
that
this
joint
had
its
priorities
straight
showcasing
solid
local
beers
alongside
its
tasty
victuals
went
for
the
stout
which
was
primo
from
boulevard
seems
their
bully
porter
gets
all
the
attention
but
have
choice
the
two
for
the
dry
stout
any
day
the
week
solid
and
great
with
the
cue

thankful
for
both
anthony

mrs
ekdahl
the
barley

did
the
trick
cutting
through

oddly
complimenting
this

returning

shout

and
the
for
letting

shadow
intern
there
were
several
days
that
was
frustrated
that
considered
flushing
degree
down
the
toilet
and
going
back
into
engineering
well
the
fact
the
matter
visited
the
kroc
homebrewing
club
and
these
great
guys
and
gals
gave
couple
job
leads
one
lead
was
that
chris
kennedy
yak
and
yeti
brewpub
was
leaving
the
new
head
brewer
for
jamil
zainasheff
heretic
brewing
smothered
chris
with
confidence
and
convinced
him
that
only
needed
show
how
brew
once
transfer
beer
once
answer
few
questions
like
how
fill
out
the
alcohol
tax
form
and
good
got
the
job
meet
the
new
head
brewer
for
the
yak
and
yeti
arvada
little
info
about
the
yak
the
yak
and
yeti
indian
and
nepalese
restaurant
that
has
been
around
since
westminster
their
food
apparently
the
best
around
can
confirm
this
after
having
eaten
there
now
they
became
sucessful
enough
after
six
years
open
second
restaurant
dol
the
yak
founder
purchased
the
old
english
style
cheshire
cat
brewpub
which
located
old
house
old
town
arvada
chris
has
been
brewing
this
barrel
system
made
from
mostly
old
dairy
equipment
for
almost
three
years
supplying
beer
for
both
restaurants
coincidentally
the
brewpub
was
also
operation
since
before
ownership
changed
currently
this
only
part
time
head
brewer
position
due
the
low
volume
beer
sales
but
optimistically
going
put
some
hard
work
into
increasing
sales
already
brewed
batch
with
chrs
and
transfered
cellared
beer
several
times
myself
the
other
exciting
opportunity
from
this
job
the
gabf
this
fall
since
chris
won
gold
medal
for
the
himalayan
ipa
last
year
the
owner
wants
submit
beers
again
first
time
attending
the
gabf
and
pouring
hand
crafted
beer
the
nation
largest
beer
festival
who
would
have
imagined
the
first
question
that
most
the
locals
ask
what
you
like
brew
what
can
expect
for
beers
can
say
for
the
first
round
probably
just
brew
chris
four
main
recipes
ipa
chai
stout
pils
and
red
ale
once
and
then
add
rotating
seasonal
most
likely
wheat
bier
since
this
was
english
brewpub
there
are
still
four
hand
pulls
place
for
cask
beer
and
room
for
eight
other
beers
tap
plentyof
room
grow
although
will
have
some
new
friendly
competition
because
just
few
blocks
away
the
arvada
beer
company
will
opening
its
doors
about
month
hoping
can
plug
each
others
beersand
both

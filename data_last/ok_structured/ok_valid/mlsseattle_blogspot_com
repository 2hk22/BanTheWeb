raising

during

everything

how

well
came
saturday
night
tough
loss
kansas
city
and
the
response
was
disappointing
during
the
game
objects
were
thrown
the
referees
though
didn
see
anything
worse
than
what
looked
like
paper
airplane
and
after
the
game
the
players
walked
off
the
pitch
the
southeast
corner
the
stadium
two
separate
fans
reportedly
threw
beer
down
the

one
the
fans
was
ejected

the

the

were
walking
off

one
fan
spit
down

can
doing

maybe
the

didn

particularly
good

guess
what
happens

not

either
have

have
smarter
and
there
excuse
for
throwing
beer
any
projectiles
really
the
players
the
pitch
ever
granted
this
was
few
isolated
incidents
and
the
majority
the
fans
were
reasonable
sending
nothing
more
than
massive
chorus
boos
the
referees
but
the
bad
apples
that
get

negative

the

saga
jeff
parke
won
signing
with
the
seattle
sounders
after
all
and
honestly
don
believe
his
fault
according
jose
romero
always
excellent
blog
the
seattle
times
jeff
parke
longer
with
the
sounders
was
barely
just
with
them
begin
with
having
played
one
reserve
match
and
practicing
couple
times
without
signing
contract
but
wednesday
left
the
team
and
seems
unlikely
return
parke
case
has
been
unusual
one
was
picked
seattle
from
new
york
the
expansion
draft
and
did
not
have
contract
with
mls
the
time
making
him
effectively
free
agent
though
his
rights
belong
seattle
for
the
next
two
years
instead
negotiating
deal
with
the
sounders
attempted
fulfill
one
his
dreams
playing
europe
but
two
trials
belgium
met
with
success
returned
the
usa
and
seattle
last
week
presumably
attempt
and
work
out
deal
that
clearly
has
fallen
through
what
the
hell
going
get
some
insight
check
out
this
interview
parke
from
last
week
one
particularly
interesting
quote
his
negotiations
with
new
york
prior
the
expansion
draft
they
gave
number
and
the
end
the
day
didn
agree
with
parke
said
his
final
contract
talks
with
new
york
that
was
that
obviously
had
some
hurt
and
some
anger
toward
the
club
for
how
was
handled
and
how
was
kind
just
left
myself
also
mentions
needing
look
out
for
his
family
something
that
has
come
with
him
multiple
times
and
that
fair
made
about
last
year
which
isn
bad
but
certainly
less
than
someone
good
him
should
making
what
this
insightful
interview
shows
that
for
parke
about
the
money
the
reason
was
left
unprotected
the
red
bulls
wasn
because
his
steroid
suspension
because
was
inferior
talent
was
that
would
have
been
too
expensive
fair
enough
parke
jumped
for
europe
trying
get
the
big
bucks
when
that
didn
work
came
back
seattle
begin
contract
talks
and
things
looked
good
but
remember
sigi
schmidt
comment
about
parke
something
along
the
lines
always
good
have
depth
from
that
and
from
the
money
parke
probably
looking
for
upwards
thousand
dollars
the
problem
was
clear
terms
the
roster
parke
was
luxury
not
necessity
the
sounders
don
have
lot
money
left
under
the
cap
and
what
they
have
they
probably
like
save
for
summer
additions
they
simply
weren
able
offer
parke
much
wanted
shame
that
jeff
parke
apparently
isn
going
work
out
seattle
very
good
player
quality

could
use
some
more
those

imagine
the
next

deficient
team
that
has
some

work
with

perhaps

michael

don

for
looking
for

the

for
not

that
makes
keeping

whoever

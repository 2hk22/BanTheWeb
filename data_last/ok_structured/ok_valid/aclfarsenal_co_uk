attacks
whatever
they
were
called
was
different
when
was
their
age
didn
have

not
even
sure
they
were

back
then
instead
went
outside

played

until

fancy

add
theo
walcott
into
this
mix
and
what
have
you
got
perhaps
the
biggest
signal
that
arsenal
are
perceived
moving
forward
certainly
opportune
time
with
reports
this
morning
that
daniel
levy
was
proper
old
school
this
morning
and
began
typing
irving
scholar
telling
the
tottenham
supporters
trust
that
their
transfer
policy
was
morphing
into
buy
sell
personally
thought
was
already
and
sure
that
they
are
bracing
themselves
for
next
summer
kane
feeding
frenzy
martin
samuel
nailed
their
problem
this

heil
nobody
overtakes
manchester

offering
helping
hand
matter
how
favourable
the
price
something
know
from
bitter
experience
step
the
right
direction
arsenal
may
taking
but
not
sure
there
tangible
answer
beyond
silverware
which
can
prove
after
all
benchmarks
football
winning
trophy
pretty
much
definite
marker
there
can
when
comes
discerning
improvements
going
from
trophies
one
two
you
greedy
good
guide
you
are
going
get
but
when
there
are
tangibles
with
handles
lids
and
engravings
how
then
you
substantiate
the
view
that
this
season
upward
sprial
league
position
always
good
one
except
the
heil
proved
arsenal
have
the
same
record
last
season
yet
occupy
second
that
arsenal
improvement
hard
sell
given
the
remarkable
similarity
each
the
columns
others
being
weaker
certainly
with
liverpool
comfortably
despatched
and
languishing
fifth
there
strong
case
for
that
the
same
with
city
five
points
worse
off
the
tricky
part
comes
when
you
compare
the
two
fixtures
lists
remaining
matches
and
factor
them
the
reality
that
improvement
intangible
most
cases
yes
league
position
can
prove
the
theory
but
only
there
marked
difference
the
column
perhaps
shows
better
harder
beat
winning
more
one
the
other
will
suffice
but
for
arsenal
this
time
around
more
with
timing

some
sparkling

chelsea

too
far
ahead
ten
points
they
win
leicester
their

that
the

the

has
happened
intangible
you
can
argue
that
alexis

improved
the

disagree
but
there
indisputable
truth
irrefutable
evidence
that
you
can
offer
prove
the
point
just
case
that
you
and
are
unison
that
believe
that
arsenal
are
improving
now
you
had
asked
that
question
that
last
autumn
would
have
disagreed
but
that
was
down
giroud
koscielny
and
zil
being
missing
well
that
doesn
quite
stack
because
they
were
missing
for
five
premier
league
games
trio
and
were
already
eighth
that
time
bigger
impact
was
aaron
ramsey
injury
view
and
let
honest
the
start
this
season
was
more
continuation
the
end
when
limped
over
the
line
happens
the
missing
link
turned
out
energetic
defensive
midfielder
protecting
the

four
who

that

the

the

achieving
the

the

the

rhode
island
has
plenty
winter
beauty
leaving
the
path
and
venturing
into
the
quaint
new
england
towns
should
part
the
day
ride
today
was
break
the
winter
weather
that
had
the
temperature
hovering
around
the
degree
mark
the
wind
was
blowing
pretty
good
not
bad
but
good
enough
make
you
work
for
your
miles
there
were
very
few
riders
all
decked
out
their
tour
france
best
riding
hell
bent
for
glory
this
day
was
the
locals
walking
and
riding
leisurely
quite
few
who
were
obvious
commuters
with
the
tell
backpacks
paniers
and
helmets
very
little
traffic
the
roads
that
crossed
the
mup
and
there
were
times
when
was
just
and
the
low
murmur
tires
rolling
over
the
blacktop
this
the
main
dining
area
for
the
local
sea
gulls
they
drop
the
clams
onto
the
bridge
crack
them
then
gull
fine
dining
deciding
early
that
this
would
not
and
end
end
ride
the
path
dropped
off
the
town
warren
first
stop
was
the
story
theater
company
get
schedule
plays
this
very
professional
local
theater
group
that
has
captured
the
interest
the
community
the
choices
the
director
makes
what
keeps
people
going
back
many
the
productions
are
controversial
dark
times
and
quite
frankly
are
sometimes
right
the
very
edge
they
definitely
have
eliminated
all
the
prudes
and
holy
rollers
but
they
are
also
always
the
hottest
tickets
around
this
warren
thespian
group
the
hottest
ticket
around
mostly
due
their
edgy
productions
across
the
main
road
the
waterfront
district
the
east
bay
where
the
aroma
fresh
seafood
fills
the
air
clam
shacks
lobster
huts
seafood
cafes
are
abundant
the

warren
the
city
also
the

the
the

dropping
signaling
the

ride
the
return
the
head
the
trail
rail
trail
conversions
are
always
nice
way
spend
few
hours
bike
but
there
are
also
lots
thing
see
and

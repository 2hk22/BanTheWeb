leave
comment
for
little
while
now
been
kicking
around
the
idea
starting
newspaper
centered
around
original
milwaukee
music
plan
was
formulated
and
contacted
everyone
knew
who
might
interested
that
wasn
too
long
ago
but
the
idea
already
fizzling
bit
understandable
some
people
want
part
but
just
don
have
the
time
others
might
not
have
liked
approach
others
still
might
have
been
weary
the
size
the
project
going
try
and
address
all
those
problems
especially
the
last
one
typical
fashion
came
with
some
grand
scheme
how
make
the
best
thing
milwaukee
has
ever
seen
bad
move
part
that
good
way
scare
off
volunteer
staff
new
game
plan
want
start
waaaay
small
like
get
staff
people
including
myself
and
just
see
what
can
everyone
will
contribute
articles
per
month
and
reviews
interviews
opinion
etc
the
whole
paper
will
like
pages
maybe
more
depending
how
much
all
write
will
take
care
the
layout
printing
advertising
stuff
and
figure
out
very
easy
way
handle
distribution
start
with
few
hundred
copies
and
they
available
small
handful
places
stays
that
size
great
grows
great
have
more
ideas
but
let
just
start
there
and
see
what
get
just
need
the
additional
people
don
want
assume
that
those
who
were
interested
the
original
plan
will
board
for
the
revised
one
throwing
this
out
everyone
know
you
want
some

know
this
has
been
written
about
end
but
going
briefly
rant
about
again
right
ear
felt
like
was
going
little
quieter
yesterday
see
when
you
rock
band
and
you
have
show
the
best
thing
crank
all
your
amps
ask
the
sound
guy
jack
the
levels
and
have
your
drummer
hit
everything
hard
possible
the
physical
energy
from
the
sound
waves
translates
into
emotional
energy
for
your
audience
math
may
off
but
usually
about
scale
your
music
hitting
the
audience
creating
good
times
there
are
few
problems
with
this
theory
though
first
there
the
whole
problem
likely
hearing
loss
and
also
severe
pain
which
usually
happens
somewhere
north
thankfully
there
are
nice
ear
plugs
for
that
stuff
which
nobody
uses
the
other
part
when
you
crank
your
music
like
this
you
being
dick
and
usually
means
your
band
shit
not
the
shit
shit
dead
giveaway
seasoned
audience
members
when
they
see
band
that
keeps
cranking
the
volume
during
sound
check
the
first
few
songs
usually
because
the
band
stinks
and
they
need
the
cacophony
loud
give
the
illusion
cohesive
musicianship
you
think
your
band
good
you
doing
yourself
great
disservice
behind
our
ears
cannot
distinguish
much
any
the
nuances
your
playing
get
lost
giant
whirlwind
noises
imagine
loud
harley
jackhammer
and
circular
saw
all
running
small
room
the
same
time
just
becomes
blur
you
can
distinguish
one
noise
from
the
other
beyond
that
unless
you
are
playing
club
that
supports
few
hundred
people
chances
are
the
system
can
support
your
volume
the
usual
person
venue
you
lucky
the
can
support
your
vocals
over
the
natural
volume
drumset
and
watt
tube
amp
once
you
mic
the
snare
kick
and
guitar
amp
and
crank
them
all
you
are
assuring
yourself
that
the
will
start
clipping
distorting
and
nobody
will
able
understand
the
lyrics
maybe
even
know
anyone
singing
not
saying
that
your
noise
rock
band
needs
playing
cafe
poetry
night
volumes
but
actually
listen
yourself
more
often
when
you
doing
sound
check
rather
than
just
making
really
loud
stage
volume
and
assuming
great
have
band
member
trusted
friend
out
into
the
audience
try
playing
song
with
guitars
drums
vocals
you
small
venue
around
milwaukee
that
might
the
cactus
club
have
the
drummer
play
with
mics
then
run
the
guitar
vocals
through
the
turn
the
volume
until
everything
sounds
pretty
level
with
the
drummer
then
you
can
mic
some
the
drums
few
things
are
getting
lost
you
don
believe
stick
camcorder
the
back
room
and
record
one
your
normal
shows
compared
one
where
you
sound
like
that
tell
which
one
sounds
better
you
think
the
absurdly
loud
one
does
probably
means
your
band
needs
more

february

leave

his
recovery
now
reported
going
well
didn
hurt
his
back
leg
guess
that
might
easier
deal
with
and
never
been
mobile
let
just
pretend
that
everything
goes
great
from
here
out
and
essentially
tom
brady
from
day
one
this
season
that
being
the
case
let
assume
brady
avoids
major
injuries
and
very
productive
member
the
pats
for
another
years
before
retiring
keeping
cassel
for
that
period
may
very
well
cost
the
patriots
tony
romo
money
which
way
more
than
any
team
would
invest
backup
won
happen
say
that
cassel
needs
that
all
makes
wonder
what
are
the
scenarios
where
could
happen
this
year
chances
are
teams
will
seriously
consider
cassel
based
how
played
last
year
didn
finish
the
season
with
wimper
like
anderson
did
cleveland
last
year
actually
kept
getting
better
there
chance
could
viable
option
starting
for
team
need
with
other
considerations
here
are
teams
that
may
want
starting
this
year
tampa
bay
carolina
minnesota
tennessee
louis
detroit
kansas
city
new
york
jets
san
francisco
that
list
tampa
depends
what
they
with
garcia
carolina
may
not
give
delhomme
yet
minnesota
and
tennessee
both
have
vets
and
irradic
young
guys
that
they
may
keep
around
kansas
city
has
thigpen
who
played
decently
last
year
louis
still
has
bulger
although
hasn
looked
too
good
the
jets
might
have
favre
san
fran
may
stick
with
hill
detroit
the
only
team
that
really
has
worthwhile
option
however
plays
almost
good
did
last
year
put
cassel
more
attractive
option
than
any
those
teams
currently
have
you
think
long
term
the
case
tampa
carolina
minny
tennessee
who
potentially
going
make
move
tampa
bay
think
this
team
too
difficult
figure
out
the
moment
don
know
they
are
going
blow
the
current
roster
just
try
and
keep
things
going
for
year
two
and
figure
out
what
next
seems
like
they
tried
keep
continuity
the
coaching
spots
the
latter
might
true
carolina
they
have
talent
defense
good
offensive
line
and
running
game
and
few
good
receivers
they
also
have
who
completely
self
destructed
the
playoffs
and
wasn
just
about
opponent
talent
watch
the
raider
game
delhomme
has
been
all
over
the
place
his
entire
career
and
think
carolina
may
consider
change
however
afford
cassel
they
definitely
have
get
out
delhomme
contract
and
don
see
that
happening
chances
are
they
for
via
the
draft
minnesota
brad
childress
has
stuck
behind
tavaris
jackson
like
his
brother
something
however
think
might
starting
seriously
doubt
jackson
will
ever
develop
into
real
starting
chances
are
childress
will
lose
his
job
before
that
happens
minnesota
has
been
very
agressive
bringing
talent
recently
and
hasn
paid
off
because
they
had
jackson
and
gus
frerotte
quarterback
you
not
going
win
with
either
player
because
all
seen
even
the
best
running
games
can
get
shut
down
and
you
need
make
plays
via
the
air
neither
guy
can
get
done
minnesota
has
the
pick
the
draft
which
immediately
before
the
patriots
pick
kind
weird
pick
back
back
but
fairly
desireable
spot
you
get
quality
player
without
the
massive
financial
burden
could
see
this
deal
happening
tennessee
kerry
collins
years
old
and
vince
young
getting
top
draft
pick
money
much
believe
neither
will
get
you
championship
don
see
the
titans
going
different
direction
louis
bulger
has
made
big
steps
backwards
recently
but
the
team
around
him
has
been
horrible
too
hard
tell
really
has
been
declining
the
team
around
him
has
just
been
too
bad
chances
are
louis
will
work
building
with
their
lines
the
draft
and
keep
bulger
until
they
have
decent
team
around
him
and
evaluate
from
there
detroit
they
need
along
with
lot
other
help
all
seen
what
happens
when
bad
team
puts
rookie
quarterback
the
field
and
there
sure
fire
lock
for
the
pick
this
point
detroit
could
keep
their
pick
and
get
offensive
tackle
but
think
they
really
like
franchise
the
problem
with
this
trade
though
the
pick
the
patriots
have
desperate
position
need
except
slowly
add
youth
their
linebackers
maybe
one
the
hybrid
olb
guys
could
shoot
the
boards
and
justify
top
pick
but
while
that
would
certainly
benefit
the
pats
don
know
that
they
want
throw
all
that
money
somebody
kansas
city
very
interesting
option
here
kansas
city
has
ton
young
players
develop
and
they
need
help
every
position
they
also
happen
have
scott
pioli
running
their
show
now
knows
cassel
and
out
also
wants
complete
culture
change
with
the
chiefs
and
new
offensive
leader
great
way
unlike
the
situation
with
mangini
going
the
jets
this
isn
some
big
rivalry
again
got
the
problem
high
draft
spot
not
being
very
attractive
but
the
spot
little
easier
live
with
than
who
knows
would
put
this
possibility
new
york
jets
maybe
favre
comes
back
maybe
doesn
maybe
the
team
still
believes
kellen
clemens
maybe
not
either
way
can
imagine
the
patriots
trade
anybody
value
within
their
division
they
saw
what
happened
last
year
the
jets
let
pennington
miami
who
knocked
new
york
out
the
playoffs
the
end
the
year
new
england
too
smart
organization
let
that
happen
san
francisco
never
sure
what
make
this
organization
they
have
lot
turmoil
their
division
age
injuries
coaching
problems
seattle
rebuilding
louis
massive
coaching
staff
turnover
arizona
and
they
could
solid
move
two
away
from
stealing
that
division
they
liked
shaun
hill
last
year
but
let
face
not
the
answer
for
any
team
interested
being
serious
competitor
they
are
going
take
decent
hit
when
they
likely
cut
former
pick
alex
smith
but
that
better
than
keeping
him
the
roster
just
based
numbers
the
ers
have
attractive
pick
overall
think
based
where
the
team
was
the
end
last
year
and
what
the
possibilities
are
their
division
they
could

the

myself
and
countless

had

throughout

total

basically
the

that
reassures
you
that
nobody

cares

who

beyond
that
they

you
watch

for

using

september
never
forget
name
david
dave
brock
and
although
grew
sweet
home
alabama
the
mountains
north
carolina
have
been
home
for
about
years
adventures
probably
started
youngster
when
grandpa
grady
sent
into
the
woods
hunt
rabbit
for
supper
since
then
unyielding
curiosity
and
love
for
the
outdoors
has
reached
far
from
grandfather
acre
farm
shelby
county
all
corners
north
america
where
have
hiked
paddled
and
bicycled
for
many
thousands
miles
even
after
completing
college
knew
that
the
traditional
sense
career
meant
nothing
unless
also
included
open
avenue
core
values
which
included
meaningful
work
and
outdoor
adventure
following
heart
and
dreams
all
the
other
stuff
such
job
career
have
naturally
fallen
into
place
instead
waking
each
day
victim
somebody
elses
world
centered
entire
life
more
around
the
idea
following
own
unique
path
while
always
dreaming
about
the
mysteries
that
lie
just
around
that
next
bend
the
river
over
that
next
hill
the
trail
along
the
way
have
found
happiness
overall
contentment
resulting
from
having
the
courage
follow
own
dreams
and
henry
david
thoreau
once
said
man
does
not
keep
pace
with
his
companions
perhaps
because
hears
different
drummer
let
him
step
the
music
which
hears
however
measured
far
away
when
folks
ask
why
did
you
hike
the
appalachian
trail
for
months
paddle
the
yukon
river
miles
across
alaska
can
summed
easily
into
four
simple
words
freedom
the
trail
life
short
where
better
than
the
wilderness
can
person
explore
the
mysteries
what
means
human
and
besides
don
have
any
other
choice
just
like
eating
and
breathing
enter
the
wilderness
something
that
can
seem
live
without
hope
that
this
website
will
serve
resource

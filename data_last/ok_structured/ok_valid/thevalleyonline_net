hey
becky
what
your
name
posted
july
john
guys
have
get
george
dale
and
austin
looked
like
was
crazy
after
all
just
went
the
bathroom
and
their
spot
the
bar
was
the
way
the
only
regular
exit
the
joint
had
been
hanging
out
and
drinking
with
george
for
the
most
the
night
for
his
birthday
has
specifically
asked
come
and
party
austin
kind
thought
that
the
night
was
bust
until
this
point
because
george
did
not
appear
getting
drunk
all
then
said
needed
the
bathroom
and
started
move
looked
like
your
stereotypical
movie
drunk
you
know
swaying
side
side
sure
had
stopped
long
enough
talk
would
have
spoken
slurred
with
hiccups
between
every
few
words
because
that
how
people
get
drunk
movies
least
old
movies
staggered
off
saw
him
the
totally
wrong
direction
for
the
bathroom
started
after
him
point
him
the
right
direction
the
time
had
caught
with
him
had
gone
through
door
the
back
the
bar
this
happened
employees
only
section
the
bar
went
through
the
door
saw
two
employees
trying
figure
out
what
with
him
tried
intervene
george
george
what
are
you
doing
the
bathroom
over
here
george
looked
with
bleary
eyes
straddling
that
border
comprehension
come
george
george
started
towards
and
right
before
got
the
point
where
could
escort
him
out
the
restricted
area
and
the
bathroom
took
turn
down
side
hallway
george
this
way
come
this
way
george
you
might
reading
this
and
think
that
sounded
like
was
coaxing
dog
follow
out
the
house
something
without
context
sure
might
have
found
that
talking
the
extremely
drunk
myself
included
works
best
when
you
treat
them
like
beloved
family
pet
you
like
them
but
boy
does
piss
you
off
when
they
pee
puke
your
carpet
george
finally
turned
around
and
got
going
the
right
direction
but
when
finally
came
one
the
employees
said
that
enough
out
here
that
fine
think
needs
home
now
anyways
just
head
out
looked
like
thought
was
trying
pull
one
over
him
and
said
has
out
the
back
can
out
the
front
door
that
too
just
out
the
back
with
him
you
can
out
the
back
now
was
getting
little
confused
and
know
hadn
had
that
much
drink
wait
minute
you
telling
that
too
drunk
stay
your
bar
but
that
sober
enough
kicked
out
into
your
alley
with
one
help
him
that
the
rules
man
well
fuck
that
going
with
him
coming
with
out
the
front
door
this
the
guy
was
talking
made
finger
gesture
the
air
towards
wasn
sure
what
was
doing
until
few
moments
later
this
mountain
human
being
came
and
asked
there
was
problem
responded
hell
yeah
there
problem
these
asshats
are
kicking
friend
out
and
they
won
let
with
him
ensure
doesn
get
himself
killed
your
alleyway
sir
going
have
ask
you
leave
fine
out
the
back
door
with
him
can
allow
that
realizing
that
only
options
were
get
ass
kicked
the
walking
everest
try
and
catch
with
george
running
around
the
building
ran
back
friends
who
were
now
looking
like
was
crazy
quickly
explained
what
had
happened
them
and
ran
out
the
bar
split
opposite
directions
around
the
building
that
hopefully
wouldn
miss
him
one
way
but
turns
out
drunk
george
was
lot
faster
than
thought
would
the
time
got
the
back
was
gone
never
good
thing
really
trashed
and
lost
but
really
trashed
and
lost
city
that
you
don
live
really
not
good
started
calling
george
and
got
ahold
him
after
couple
calls
heyyyyyy
man
george
where
are
you
answered
but
was
loud
the
street
that
couldn
hear
asked
again
couldn
hear
you
man
where
are
you
try
speak
where
are
the
bitches
are
assuming
that
wandered
back
street
headed
back
the
intersection
that
the
bar
was
near
you
where
the
bitches
are
can
you
raise
your
hands
the
air
like
don
care
yeah
raise
your
hands
the
air
like
you
don
care
waited
for
minute
and
didn
see
anyone
around
doing
this
tried
something
different
hey
check
loopt
then
can
figure
out
where
you
are
had
few
difficulties
getting
into
the
app
and
figuring
out
his
drunken
haze
how
but
eventually
checked
and
discovered
that
had
managed
walk
about
three
blocks
from
where
were
stay
there
george
don
move
foot
don
worry
man
gonna
stay
where
the
bitches
are
ran
fast
could
and
found
george
fairly
deserted
intersection
this
was
where
all
the
bitches
were
they
were
invisible
hailed
cab
and
started
make
the
trip
home
along
the
way
guess
that
george
decided
that
was
going
flirty
few
seconds
after
the
cab
driver
becky
told
her
name
george
started
saying
hey
becky
what
your
name
becky
repeatedly
asked
her
and
the
first
few
times
she
actually
answered
that
her
name
was
becky
after
that
she
just
stopped
paying
attention
becky
was
fairly
good
natured
about
the
whole
thing
and
only
got
angry
when
looked
like
george
might
throw
her
cab
other
than
george
singing
variety
rap
songs
the
way
the
house
the
rest
the
night
was
fairly
uneventful
really
wanted
see
could
get
some
app
company
sponsor
our
night
for
being
able
find
your
friends
when
they
have
been
kicked
out
the
back
bar
and
are
drunk
and
you
can
find
them
guess
the
use
case
was
little
too
specific
though

may
john
most
people
could
probably
tell
you
the
state
flower
the
state
they
live
live
texas
and
the
state
flower
the
bluebonnet
found
out
the
other
day
that
the
flower
not
the
only
state
symbol
that
texas
has
for
instance
the
state
small
mammal
texas
the
armadillo
the
state
large
mammal
the
texas
longhorn
those
seemed
pretty
straightforward
but
looked
further
and
here
some
other
interesting
stuff
found
the
state
grass
sideoats
grama
don
even
know
what
that
the
state
dinosaur
pleurocoelus
what
the
fuck
state
dinosaur
that
not
even
half
the
state
symbols
that
found
but
was
looking
through
there
and
found
that
there
were
some
categories
that
weren
even
listed
here
lame
attempt
right
this
wrong
going
provide
the
missing
categories
here
and
suggestions
for
filling
those
categories
for
texas
and
possibly
some
other
states
the
state
medieval
weapon
texas
the
state
medieval
weapon
texas
was
actually
lot
harder
decide
upon
than
thought
would
the
first
thing
that
came
mind
was
claymore
big
two
handed
sword
for
those
you
who
weren
nerd
growing
like
was
and
still
because
huge
sword
then
thought
well
lance
probably
bigger
than
sword
maybe
that
should
then
came
the
thought
catapult
the
big
bad
seige
weapon
you
probably
notice
along
through
this
that
most
suggestions
deal
with
size
you
don
live
texas
then
you
might
not
have
heard
that
everything
bigger
texas
according
the
commercials
these
same
commercials
tell
that
everything
better
dodge
but
have
yet
see
proof
that
that
the
reasoning
behind
most
choices
the
state
medieval
weapon
rhode
island
yeah
rhode
island
again
not
easy
you
might
think
built
the
reasoning
for
the
weapon
texas
and
thought
several
but
the
end
settled
the
dirk
really
small
dagger
always
seen
this
weapon
yes
saying
that
like
think
about
this
more
often
than
probably
should
kind
afterthought
the
blacksmith
whoever
was
making
weapons
had
some
left
over
steel
and
they
needed
something
with
they
made
this
tiny
weapon
that
generally
has
purpose
that
right
rhode
island
just
did
said
that
your
state
was
afterthought
and
generally
has
purpose
the
state
venereal
disease
texas
know
what
you
thinking
thought
too
how
the
hell
could
this
have
not
been
included
the
list
already
found
this
out
and
made
snap
judgement
the
state
texas
has
the
clap
not
afraid
admit
that
reasoning
was
incredibly
hokey
explain
need
break
into
song
the
stars
are
bright
and
big
night
clap
clap
clap
clap
deep
the
heart
texas
and
that
friends
four
reasons
why
this
decision
correct
the
state
black
sheep
texas
every
state
has
someone
that
came
from
their
state
that
they
aren
incredibly
proud
you
might
think
that
this
would
lee
harvey
oswald
but
from
louisiana
maybe
their
state
black
sheep
you
might
then
further
down
the
line
and
think
that
jack
ruby
would
shoe
nope
from
illinois
besides
there
one
that
more
vile
and
evil
more
ruthless
than
these
two
put
together
barney
the
dinosaur
yes
barney
was
born
dallas
you
might
wonder
did
wouldn
barney
shoe
for
the
state
dinosaur
what
kind
world
this
where
pleurocoelus
beats
out
dinosaur
that
everyone
knows
even
know
his
first
name
you
can
say
that
for
pleurocoelus
think
can
end
with
that
these
are
the
new
state
symbols
that
should
included
the
list
invite
you
write
your
state
representative
ask
have
these
added
the
list
thank
you
for
your
consideration

fact
that

from

what

about
these
places
almost
everyone

women

like
big

and
cannot
lie
complete
the
picture
making
him
very
serious
about
the
karaoke
that
doing
and
add
dance
moves
that
obviously
been
practicing
and
you
have
favorite
karaoke
performer
from
the
night
was
fantastically
hilarious
and
little
sad
the
same
time
too
finished
his
song
massive
amounts
applause
and
was
easy
see
that
was
regular
and
fan
favorite
sometimes
wonder
still
performs
that
song
with
such
fervor
you
ever
desperately
needed
get
laid
few
years
ago
surprised
wife
with
surprise
birthday
party
all
went
this
italian
restaurant
that
was
byob
and
brought
many
bottles
wine
byob
always
seems
like
good
idea
until
you
realize
you
have
brought
two
bottles
too
many
and
that
you
already
drank
them
the
party
winding
down
and
she
and
have
both
had
bit
too
much
drink
much
that
convince
megan
another
friend
ours
this
bar
called
the
moose
have
some
more
drinks
had
been
sober
would
have
never
elected
there
this
place
have
avoided
like
the
plague
until
this
point
but
when
first
got
there
looked
much
like
any
other
bar
around
the
world
smokey
room
bar
the
right
dance
floor
the
left
with
one
dancing
and
overweight
playing
top
hits
from
the
past
three
decades
ordered
some
more
drinks
and
sat
for
little
bit
then
megan
and
kristen
decided
request
particular
song
from
the
soon
they
left
was
like
someone
released
pack
hungry
hounds
the
three
minutes
they
were
gone
less
than
three
women
approached
and
asked
wanted
dance
was
alone
other
such
questions
now
before
you
think
trying
call
myself
ladies
man
something
soon
said
they
went
some
other
poor
sap
that
would
talk
them
you
ever
want
desperately
get
laid
this
would
probably
the
place
though
can
vouch
for
the
quality
the
women
that
you
will
pick
security
this
was
few
weeks
ago
decided
surprise
kristen
with
night
out
fort
worth
and
staying
bed
and
breakfast
downtown
went
dinner
and
had
some
wine
with
dinner
went
improv
comedy
show
and
had
drinks
there
after
that
went
the
dueling
piano
bar
and
had
some
more
drinks
there
let
stop
the
piano
bar
now
the
first
one
say
that
not
teenager
but
the
other
side
that
token
don
really
feel
that
old
either
least
didn
until
went
the
dueling
piano
bar
this
night
the
bar
was
packed
with
middle
aged
folks
all
cramming
drink
their
apple
tinis
their
coors
light
because
they
have
watch
their
figure
some
other
drink
like
that
they
came
hear
the
pianos
because
they
aren
offensive
the
ears
that
new
fangled
rock
music
with
heavily
distorted
guitars
they
came
because
the
piano
players
will
play
the
theme
songs
from
their
favorite
shows
from
the
eighties
and
before
cheers
saved
the
bell
doogie
howser
mash
and
more
but
the
owners
the
dueling
piano
bar
didn
realize
the
vast
number
middle
aged
folks
they
would
rake
with
this
kind
fare
and
such
did
not
have
enough
chairs
for
all
their
patrons
and
their
worn
out
bones
sadly
was
one
those
patrons
after
few
too
many
drinks
one
likes
sit
down
for
awhile
and
found
ourselves
without
chairs
that
was
until
someone
got
from
table
leaving
empty
except
for
glass
with
only
couple
ice
cubes
and
what
looked
like
empty
pack
smokes
pointed
out
kristen
and
she
raced
over
the
table
and
sat
down
was
this
point
when
some
other
old
fogey
came
and
tapped
twice
the
empty
glass
were
holding
his
place
and
said
word
kristen
she
got
and
both
went
back
standing
ten
minutes
later
one
the
waitstaff
came
and
seeing
the
empty
glass
the
table
removed
figured
myself
there
still
one
sitting
there
they
have
removed
the
previous
placeholder
the
glass
the
table
mine
for
the
taking
walked
over
and
sat
down
only
have
fat
finger
tapped
twice
the
empty
cigarette
pack
saw
you
come
with
that
girl
earlier
man
you
know
that
this
table
taken
was
drunk
probably
didn
sound
this
reasoned
yeah
when
were
here
last
you
claimed
that
the
glass
was
holding
your
place
the
glass
gone
are
you
saying
that
this
piece
trash
holding
your
place
need
call
security
kind
laughed
myself
and
continued
sitting
there
thinking
myself
really
going
call
security
for
something
that
could
probably
easily
take
care
himself
mean
let
face
pretty
much
wimp
and
got
easy
pounds
wouldn
even
fight
sat
there
for
few
minutes
thinking
over
his
threat
when
guess
decided
that
his
threat
didn
really
carry
much
weight
and
pulled
the
table
away
from
sat
there
little
longer
laughed
some
more
then
went
back
kristen
and
decided
sorry
more
exciting
ending
than
that
you
wondering
why
refer
previous
statement
about
being
wimp
well
three
tales
about
three
bars
now
comes
end
sincerely
hope
you
enjoyed

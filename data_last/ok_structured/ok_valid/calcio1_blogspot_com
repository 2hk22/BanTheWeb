this
book
was
expertly
translated
cecilia
molinari
from
the
original
spanish
organized
structure
the
book
written
three
parts
with
chapters
that
span
the
years
and
respectively
you
will
learn
about
messi
life
argentina
however
the
book
not
presented
chronological
order
there
heavy
emphasis
messi
time
the
fabled
masia
youth
training
academy
barcelona
where
the
author
noted
that
only
percent
ever
make
the
senior
team
the
author
writing
style
precise
engaging
along
with
intriguing
journalistic
story
telling
quality
that
holds
your
attention
and
leaves
you
wanting
more
this
book
was
originally
written
spanish
however
the
translation
was
quite
good
its
own
right
especially
bring
light
soccer
specific
terminology
the
author
conducted
interviews
with
people
close
messi
such
his
father
brother
grandparents
first
agent
along
with
argentinean
national
team
teammate
juan
sebastian
veron
others
such
his
elementary
school
teacher
rosario
argentina
and
computer
science
teacher
the
famous
youth
academy
masia
barcelona
add
significant
detail
the
messi
mystique
comfortable
the
pitch
uncomfortable
off
might
surprise
readers
how
the
author
portrays
the
world
best
footballer
messi
shown
from
young
age
lazy
slow
polite
extremely
shy
times
petulant
and
one
who
prefers
sleep
over
social
interaction
the
author
notes
that
messi
seems
uninterested
anything
except
his
blackberry
that
does
not
involve
round
ball
faccio
describes
messi
someone
who
would
likely
unnoticed
life
not
for
his
sublime
skills
soccer
pitch
this
observation
his
former
computer
science
teacher
ruben
bonastre
who
taught
messi
how
use
computer
and
send
email
masia
barcelona
was
intriguingly
prescient
was
here
but
was
weren
but
the
messi
the
computer
class
was
not
the
same
messi
field
full
soccer
balls
the
paradox
that
met
with
his
soccer
coaches
and
they
spoke
highly
him
you
ask
yourself
how
that
enters
the
field
with
such
self
confidence
yet
lacks
real
life
page
according
the
author
messi
lover
email
with
his
blackberry
has
never
sent
one
his
former
teacher
advertising
innovator
asked
him
aim
the
camera
and
kick
the
kick
isn
simple
messi
foot
hurts
and
the
director
only
interested
getting
the
star
perform
well
for
the
take
asked
him
were
capable
making
the
shot
what
annoyed
messi
was
that
question
page
according
the
author
messi
created
soccer
advertising
industry
that
didn
exist
messi
opened
teenage
market
that
was
previously
non
existent
within
the
professional
soccer
industry
was
the
first
time
two
sports
brands
adidas
and
nike
competed
with
each
other
for
soccer
player
and
the
highest
bidder
won
page
messi
also
earns
the
bulk
his
annual
salary
from
endorsements
and
advertising
contracts
for
the
first
time
ever
team
soccer
players
earned
more
than
the
new
york
yankees
and
messi
had
the
highest
salary
the
group
earned
million
euros
and
only
third
that
came
from
his
soccer
stipend
page
breaking
the
veil
privacy
one
facet
this
book
that
didn
like
was
sharing
too
much
messi
private
life
this
was
not
autobiography
and
the
author
provided
second
third
party
accounts
messi
previously
not
aired
dirty
laundry
one
thing
the
protagonist
authorized
faccio
noted
messi
penchant
for
privacy
however
this
part
the
author
narrative
seemed
more
salacious
than
informative
felt
that
detracted
from
the
otherwise
quality
reporting
this
book
for
example
the
following
quote
gabriela
vitale
friend
messi
whom
met
via
juan
veron
prefers
seen
dumb
rather
than
horny
one
can
never
see
his
desperate
face
like
fifteen
year
old
kid
mischievous
yet
embarrassed
page
pictures
except
for
the
front
cover
there
were
pictures
this
book
pictures
with
messi
friends
family
and
teammates
over
the
years
would
have
given
this
work
more
personal
touch
sensitive
man
messi
has
rarely
been
interviewed
length
his
footballing
career
you
ask
most
fans
describe
him
they
would
hard
pressed
mention
anything
that
isn
soccer
related
seem
only
know
him
via
his
wonderful
goals
the
author
did
show
rare
glimpse
into
his
true
persona
with
the
following
quote
hurt
come
country
and
hear
that
people
said
felt
nothing
for
our
jersey
then
went
barcelona
where
did
everything
fine
and
people
loved

juan
veron
his
teammate
the
argentinean
national
team
had
the
following
observation
after
rooming
with
messi
for
days
south
africa
always
needs
play
and
win
always
looking
for
incentive
know
his
moods
his
faces
and
when
annoyed
when
asks
for
silence
must
respect
that
page
other
notable
quotes

that
getting

messi
extreme
concentration
when

isolated
from
the

page
the
frequency

the

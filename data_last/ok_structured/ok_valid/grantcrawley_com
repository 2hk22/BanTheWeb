the

despite

london

london
being

extend

euston

the
time
had

day
london
dover
the
day
started
quite
cool
setting
off
from
blackheath
and
riding
southeast
out
london
the
route
took
rochester
across
the
river
medway
and
then
down
narrow
country
lanes
all
the
way
dover
after
the
initial
coolness
the
morning
the
weather
warmed
and
the
day
turned
out
scorcher
not
necessarily
the
best
thing
for
long
distance
cyclist
but
welcome
nonetheless
some
included
missed
turning
and
ended
doing
about
miles
extra
day
calais
abbeville
after
getting
the
ferry
across
the
channel
set
off
for
abbeville
today
was
another
hot
one
and
the
tarmac
actually
felt
sticky
making
the
going
very
tough
indeed
some
places
day
abbeville
beauvais
pretty
much
the
same
the
ride
from
calais
but
little
cooler
day
beauvais
paris
from
beauvais
cycle
the
lunch
rendez
vous
from
there
cycled
into
paris
groups
around
cyclists
working
the
principle
safety
numbers
there
was
some
question
whether
would
possible
cycle
round
the
arc
triomphe
happed
needn
have
worried
certainly
experience
will
never
forget
riding
round
the
arc
and
then
down
the
champs
elysees
attempted
video
this
last
bit
but
the
cobbles
made
the
video
extremely
shakey
not
the
easiest

must
one
the
understatements

throughout
this

and
the

just

has
been
more

few

decided

one
player
chris

second
none

provides

with

that

you
might

that

would

singular
chris

allow
now
reiterate
the
key
word
here
consistency
kind
regret
letting
chris
when
awhile

was
able

him

used
gains
from
his
increase

shuffle
through
some
other
players
like
tim
duncan
marcus
camby
and
andre
iguodala
from
now
until
the

however
made
the
decision
that

suffered
dec
practiced
with
the
team
and
says
the
shoulder
feeling
fine
unfortunately
and
sad
say
the
sixers
are
doing
fine
his
absence
well
they
found
spark
from
last
year
chemistry
and
are
actually
playing
some
reasonably
consistent
fluid
basketball
now
the
question
looms
over
every
fantasy
basketball
manager
who
owns
ers
head
what
will
the
impact
brand
imminent
return
the
lineup
well
let
start
with
the
obvious
for
elton
brand
owners
well
they
won
exactly
toasting
bacardi
like
their
birthday
but
sure
they
will
pleased
even
they
get
back
the
pre
shoulder
injury
underperforming
brand
would
still
better
than
zero
production
most
free
agent
pool
pick
ups
anyway
the
bigger
issue
will
for
the
managers
who
own
andre
iguodala
andre
miller
thaddeus
young
people
still
own
samuel
dalembert
just
kidding
still
has
disappointed
ownership
yahoo
andre
iguodala
and
miller
have
rekindled
their
offensive
partnership
and
have
been
able
sneak
few
wins
for
philly
while
brand
was
away
their
scoring
and
assist
averages
got
some
upward
bumps
the
process
this
course
was
putting
smiles
their
fantasy
owners
faces
well
very
soon
the
brand
reagent
will
reintroduced
into
the
chemistry
what
remember
the
philadelphia
sixers
last
year
the
fantasy
world
may
remember
from
the
start
the
season
when
this
was
first
attempted
the
reaction
brands
introduction
wasn
eureka
expected
saw
drop
the
stats
brand
himself
andre
iguodala
andre
miller
and
the
hardest
hit
course
was
samuel
dalembert
brand
and
the
sixers
are
not
necessarily
bad
elemental
mix
per
entirely
possible
that
just
matter
being
slow
process
for
brand
properly
and
completely
integrated
into
the
sixer
molecule
sadly
folks
this
time
around
will
pretty
much
the
same
the
first
mixture
brand
injury
only
served
delay
his
jelling
with
his
new
team
and
vice
versa
expect
both
andres
and
sam
dam
stats
dip
again
brand
will
most
likely
coming
back
produce
his
and
his
minutes
per
game
don
sell
off
your
andres
iggy
and
miller
just
yet
fine
wouldn
fault
you
you
dumped
your
dalemberts
post
all
star
break
just
around
the
corner
and
when
the
brand
reagent
finally
gets
bind
properly
with
the
other
elements
the
compound
things
should
begin
stabilize
from
there
until
then
iguodala
miller
and
young
owners
simply
buckle
and
get
ready
for
another
and
down
ride
well
until
then
samuel
dalembert
may
relegated
back

long

fantasy
owner
myself
leagues
wondering
what
impact
hinrich
healthy
return
will
have
guy
personally
would
like
hope
that
head
coach
vinny
del
negro
will
appreciate
derrick
averages
ppg
and
apg
and
keep
his
minutes
currently
above
the
mark
then
again
not
the
coach
and
somehow
doubt
that
the
bulls
coaching
staff
will
plan
their
rotation
around
fantasy
basketball
needs
and
whims
will
joined
the
many
derrick
rose
and
ben
gordon
fantasy
owners
closely
watching
the
impact
kirk
return
our
guys
minutes
and
production
far
things
look
positive
for
derrick
still
managed
play
kirk
first
game
back
possible
that
kirk
may
not
actually
end
being
the
thorn
for
rose
hopefully
and
fellow
injury
returnee
luol
deng
will
eat
the
minutes
the
less
productive
members
the
bulls
roster
the
biggest
loser
far
the
rotation
game
appears
larry
hughes
who
just
logged
pitiful
minutes
the
floor
kirk
averaged
points
assists
treys
steals
and
minutes
over
games
for
the
bulls
last
season
little
too
soon
make
judgement
the
true
and
actual
fantasy
impact
kirk
return
has
that
derrick
and
ben
value
let
keep
eye
his
second
game
back
which
few
hours
and
take

there

after
that
point
performance
against
the
lakers
off
the
bench
can
foresee
him
taking
back
his
starting
role
the
next
game
what
interesting
about
that
the
thing
more
like
incident
that
prompted
make
the
move
was
seeing
mike
get
picked
from
the
wires
man
roto
there
aren
many
active
managers
that
league
and
guess
lot
managers
didn
really
care
sit
him
seeing
that
pick
was
enough
osmosis
moxy
for
ahead
and
risk
few
games
lost
the
daily
changes
ironically
shortly
after
the

broke
out
yahoo

notes
that
mike
was
minutes

glitch
occurred
for
brief
period
the
old

him
being
out
indefinitely
due
tendonitis
his
knee
started

you
clicked

closely
during

you
know
what
mean
the
guy
who
inspired
pick
him
quickly
dropped
his
acquisition
for
sadly
underwhelming
fransisco

this
was
fortuity
finest
was
the
most
active

with

got

had

was

hopefully
healthy
mike

obviously

superior
choice
for

that

case
you
are

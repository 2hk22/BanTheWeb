winsford
swim
camp
over
february
half
term
winsford
swim
team
took
swimmers
from
juggernaut
squad
kingham
school
the
cotswolds
this
swim
camp
was
designed
challenging
but
also
fun
giving
all
swimmers
many
happy
memories
long
the
way
was
put
the
calendar
give
all
our
swimmers
that
extra
boost
for
the
spring
and
summer
competitions
ahead
and
personally
thought
this
years
swim
camp
was
huge
success
more
ways
than
one
said
above
the
camp
was
challenging
but
everyone
rose
that
challenge
and
were
very
focused
for
the
task
hand
had
double
sessions
daily
plus
land
training
and
team
games
the
days
were
very
busy
but
free
time
was
scheduled
everyone
could
relax
and
socialise
with
each
other
would
lying
say
that
there
was
moaning
from
time
time
due
the
difficulty
the
sets
but
have
say
the
vast
majority
swimmers
did
train
their
very
best
and
got
huge
amount
from
the
camp
and
the
end
the
day
that
all
can
ask
off
any
swimmer
this
year
was
different
last
year
took
double
the
number
swimmers
were
two
houses
and
had
two
schedules
with
double
the
amount
pool
time
and
double
the
amount
land
training
time
accommodate
all
the
swimmers
could
have
been
logistical
nightmare
but
have
say
massive

our
gspa
members
and
friends
first
and
foremost
are
palomino
club
and
sadly
interest
phba
shows
has
fallen
off
longer
makes
sense
fly
judges
from
out
state
with
all
the
related
expenses
judge
only
few
horses
also
has
frustrating
for
our
exhibitors
who
put
much
effort
into
their
horses
only
find
one
show
against
and
points
available
the
gspa
board
has
made
the
disappointing
decision
put
our
palomino
shows
hold
until
feel
there
enough
interest
start
again
have
also
decided
put
the
open
shows
hold
want
thank
all
you
for
supporting
over
the
years
and
hopefully
will
see
you
again
happy
trails

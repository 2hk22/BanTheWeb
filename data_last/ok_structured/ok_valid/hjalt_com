history
the
shetland
isles
were
possession
norway
until
the
century
the
norseman
brought
with
them
nordic
sheepdogs
the
nordic
sheepdog
pictured
the
left
bears
remarkable
resemblance
today
sheltie
the
medium
sized
nordic
sheepdog
received
occasional
infusions
outside
blood
from
icelandic
stock
and
were
used
the
islands
until
the
when
working
collies
were
introduced
the
native
nordic
dog
and
the
early
collie
then
fused
form
medium
sized
sheltie
prototype
the
size
the
dog
was
reduced
combination
environmental
factors
and
crosses
with
the
king
charles
spaniel
and
the
original
pomeranian
differing
type
from
those
see
today
the
norsemen
called
the
islands
hjaltland
this
was
later
anglicized
the

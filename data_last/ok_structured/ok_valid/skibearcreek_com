great
write
about
the
past
snowmobile
drag
races
from
american
snowmobiler
this
past
weekend
attended
our
second
last
event
for
the
winter
season
the
annual
hill
drag
bear
creek
mountain
resort
macungie
pennsylvania
some
have
said
this
the
premier
hill
drag
event
the
east
would
have
agree
this
event
had
more
than
spectators
with
racers
coming
from
far
away
canada
and
mich
teams
that
made
the
trip
included
team
priceless
from
michigan
busted
knuckles
racing
from
canada
and
several
teams
from
penn
including
wakpak
racing
sled
tek
racing
and
patrick
hoopes
racing
with
all
the
events
attend
throughout
the
season
this
one
would
recommend
everyone
held
great
resort
offering
everything
from
great
dining
spa
with
indoor
and
outdoor
pool
and
hot
tubs
what
better
way
relax
from
day
racing
then
sitting
hot
tub
enjoying
massage
they
offer
discounted
room
rates
for
the
racers
and
spectators
attending
the
event
information
from
the
event
they
have
just
classes
ranging
from
kitty
cat
all
the
way
open
outlaw
including
vintage
the
event
had
the
largest
turn
out
have
seen
with
total
snowmobiles
giving
way
entries
this
made
for
some
huge
sled
counts
with
the
largest
being
the
stock
class
with
entries
including
surprising
open
outlaw
entries
with
some
huge
horsepower
machines
making
for
some
great
racing
and
super
close
photo
finishes
this
another
event
that
runs
double
elimination
race
making
sure
that
every
racer
gets
least
two
runs
the
hill
they
limit
each
sled
enter
only
classes
which
helps
with
the
organization
the
event
the
racing
started
and
was
completed
with
major
issues
arguments
would
have
say
that
was
impressive
get
thru
that
many
entries
that
amount
time
some
the
winning
results
the
event
are
mod

when
woke
this
morning
thought
was
going
was
going
another
let
down
but
wasn
soon
went
outside
shovel
the
walks
realized
should
packing
gear
today
the
snow
was
light
and
fluffy
was
sweeping
off
the
walks
with
broom
this
kind
snow
almost
never
falls
from
the
ski
macungie
quickly
packed
gear
and
quick
lunch
and
headed
work
pulling
the
employee
lot
the
trails
looked
great
went
office
checked
emails
and
finished
any
pressing
projects
then
quickly
booted
decided
get
chair
side
fast
could
took
chair
came
down
drifter
and
went
through
the
family
park
both
trails
were
excellent
and
there
was
still
plenty
fresh
snow
found
then
lapped
timberline
broadway
polar
bear
and
ended
the
day
with
quick
run
down
sasquatch
this
was
far
best
day
out
bear
creek
this
season
the
snow
was
perfect
crowds
were
minimal
and
every
run
still
had
tracked
lines
now
sitting
here
typing
this
all
can
think
about
booting
back
and
taking
few
more
runs
but
unfortunately
cannot
play
all
day
and
have
some
work
you
have
the
time
highly
recommend
getting
out
and
enjoying
the
slopes
today
least
sometime
this
week

grabbing

for

this

however
easier
than
usual
because
did
something
never
had
before
which
was
ski
new
year
eve
the
mailing
list
bear
creek
mountain
resort
macungie
pennsylvania
and
several
weeks
earlier
learned
their
new
year
eve
party
with
fireworks
since
had
plans
and
had
never
been
there
any
other
ski
resort
new
year
eve
decided
give
bcmr
try
late
afternoon
december
friend
and
headed
out
route
into
pennsylvania
the
slopes
were
open
till
planned
boot
and
get
outside
ski
for
several
hours
then
hit
the
lodge
for
meal
around
grabbing
bite
earlier
would
allow
view
the
sparkles
ushering
the
new
year
have
tell
you
was
really
with
this
surprisingly
not
little
ski
resort
our
evening
began
guest
services
get
lift
tickets
where
were
greeted
carol
sicher
guest
services
manager
the
staff
the
front
desk
were
genuinely
helpful
and
had
delightful
conversation
with
carol
who
gave
some
insight
bear
creek
mtn
resort
before
heading
out
the
slopes
the
base
lodge
very
modern
design
architecturally
pleasing
and
the
firm
designing
this
complex
knew
what
base
lodge
should
have
got
input
from
the
owners
what
they
wanted
for
this
resort
amenities
were
obvious
including
lockers
each
floor
and
restrooms
everywhere
you
expect
them
someone
finally
figured
out
not
fun
safe
walk
down
flights
stairs
clunky
boots
for
rest
room
when
you
need
one
the
entire
complex
first
class
contemporary
good
eye
appeal
ski
racks
where
they
should
rental
shop
when
you
first
come
and
separate
shop
for
tuning
and
repairs
the
two
don
clash
the
dining
area
adjacent
the
cafeteria
pleasantly
decorated
has
beautiful
stone
fireplace
holds
hundreds
and
was
full
new
year
eve
the
lodge
conveniently
connected
the
hotel
making
easy
for
hotel
guests
get
breakfast
before
heading
out
ski
you
want
drink
one
minor
quirk
that
the
bar
and
cafe
are
rather
long
walk
from
the
cafeteria
but
being
attached
the
hotel
very
convenient
for
overnight
guests
opting
for
the
cafe
rather
than
the
cafeteria
ordered
our
meal
and
five
minutes
was
hand
delivered
the
adjoining
bar
just
outside
the
base
lodge
sits
inviting
steaming
pool
didn
see
anyone
swimming
probably
due
the
fact
many
were
dressed
for
new
years
eve
and
the
rest
were
skiing
and
was
night
time
more
trails
were
closed
than
open
due
uncooperative
weather
for
weeks
but
those
open
were
good
shape
credit
their
snowmakers
that
nye
many
snow
guns
were
blowing
that
virtual
blizzard
was
progress
love
resorts
that
cater
those
who
enjoy
the
snowsports
and
nice
amenity
was
the
complimentary
slopeside
ski
valet
check
skis
boards
releasing
from
hunting
for
them
the
racks
for
any
who
never
been
bcmr
here
run
down
the
mtn
stats
which
puts
even
keel
with
the
pocono

bear

summit

green
blue

you
looking
for
family
friendly
skiing
upscale
modern

with

lodging
the
country
this
the
place
not
huge
mountain
but
the
ski
experience
was
surprisingly
good
and
the
drive
shorter
than
going
the
catskills
recommend
for
day
two
skiing
for
families
with
longer
stay
the

with

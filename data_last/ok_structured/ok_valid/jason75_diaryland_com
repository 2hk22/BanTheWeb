things
first
guess
sorry
have
been
lazy
with
updating
years
between
updates
probably
some
sort
crazy
record
thought
might
fun
tinker
with
the
diary
again
and
see
how
turns
out
also
may
stop
from
disappearing
into
the
internet
ether
whole
bunch
life
chronicled
here
the
time
since
the
birth
beautiful
son
oliver
much
has
happened
turned
two
last
week
now
has
three
month
old
sister
named
audrey
rose
heidi
and
had
always
said
wanted
two
kids
boy
first
followed
girl
less
than
two
years
apart
shows
how
freaky
things
are
when
you
actually
tell
the
universe
what
you
want
live
little
house
minute
walk
from
the
beach
bank
manager
again
seems
lot
life
and
something
generally
pretty
good
may
well
let
that
river
take
where
wants
still
online
junky
but
put
much
more
time
into
less
creative
things
rather
than
trying
stay
imaginative
here
toyed
with
myspace
for
while
but
even
that
has
fallen
the
wayside
the
facebook
highway
for
those
not
already
friends
please
come
and
join
user
name
thingy
nosajnosnibor
cunningly
also
name
backwards
one
will
figure
that
out
surely
lots
photos
life
there
which
saves
trying
remember
coding
for
the
diary
here
always
sucked
that
and
spent
lot
time
looking
back
old
entries
and
copy
and
pasting
the
coding
from
there
anyway
that
probably
enough
update
for
now
keep

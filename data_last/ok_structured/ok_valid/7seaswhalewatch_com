why

have

breaching

that

from
our

about
why
whales
sometimes
engage
this
most
spectacular
behaviors
thus
figured
write

about

long
but
hope
you
will

and
interesting

and
all

about

whale
watching

during

fall
many
september
and

breaching
perhaps
the
most
sought
after
behavior
whale
watchers
and
certainly
the
most
common
photo
any
whale
watch
company
brochure
this
spectacular
display
athletic
prowess
the
whale
will
dive
beneath
the
surface
for
few
seconds
minutes
only
surface
vertically
with
great
speed
often
the
animal
will
twist
while
mid
air
and
then
come
crashing
down
with
thunderous
splash
while
all
whales
have
the
ability
breach
none
often
the
humpback
whale
but
while
breaching
quite
common
amongst
humpback
whales
certainly
not
something
that
see
every
whale
watching
trip
trying
predict
the
odds
seeing
whale
breach
when
you
whale
watching
difficult
essence
your
chances
seeing
humpback
whale
breach
quite
good
maybe
when
there
are
lot
whales
the
area
when
there
are
fewer
whales
the
area
the
chances
that
one
them
will
become
active
course
less
maybe
less
than
some
extent
least
the
chances
seeing
breaching
given
trip
dependent
upon
the
overall
abundance
whales
another
reason
that
predicting
when
whales
will
become
active
that
there
time
the
year
day
that
whales
are
more
likely
breach
you
simply
need
the
right
place
the
right
time
see
when
does
obviously
the
more
time
you
spend
watching
whales
the
better
the
chances
you
will
see
one
breach
ultimately
that
really
how
all
nature
watching
works
the
more
time
you
spend
watching
the
more
you
will
see
sure
there
are
those
that
out
their
first
whale
watch
and
see
lots
breaching
active
whales
but
that
really
just
luck
there
are
plenty
people
who
whale
watching
many
many
times
before
seeing
whale
breach
all
averages
out
the
one
possible
exception
this
that
seems
breaching
may
happen
more
rough
weather
than
calm
seas
can
reward
for
people
who
venture
out
sea
less
than
ideal
days
explain
the
reason
for
this
possible
connection
between
rough
weather
and
surface
activity
bit
but
why
they
breach
all
this
talk
about
what
the
humpback
whales
when
they
breach
and
when
they
are
likely
doesn
tell
anything
about
why
they
are
doing
there
are
many
different
theories
that
have
been
put
forth
that
attempt
explain
breaching
behavior
and
honest
think
they
are
all
true
least
some
the
time
some
the
main
theories
include

humpback
whales
especially
sometimes
carry

external
well
internal
parasites
that
may
cause
itching
and
irritation

sensitive

these
parasites
include
barnacles

lot
like
you
were
for
walk
after
eating
big
meal
feeding
humpback
whale
just
for
fun
certainly
the
case
young
calves
breaching
could
very
often
just
for
fun
young
whales
just
like
the
young
any
mammal
have
keen
sense
play
which
actually
quite
important
for
exercising
growing
bones
and
muscles
well
building
body
awareness
and
coordination
breaching
humpback
whale
calf
just
like
puppy
kitten
even
human
toddler
whale
calves
can
very
playful
and
active
especially
when
the
adults
are
occupied
with
other
things
like
feeding
imagine
bringing
child
restaurant
where
you
are
meeting
few
friends
who
are
also
bringing
their
kids
when
you
and
the
other
adults
are
gathered
around
the
table
talking
about
grown
stuff
the
kids
might
get
little
bored
restless
and
start
running
around
and
getting
into
mischief
this
might
similar
when
the
adult
whales
are
busy
feeding
the
massive
schools
fish
commonly
found
our
area
and
the
calves
are
left
unattended
the
most
widely
accepted
theory
whale
surface
activity
however
that
non
vocal
form
communication
amongst
whales
you
are
fortunate
enough
take
whale
watching
trip
stellwagen
bank
jeffrey
ledge
and
witness
surface
active
humpback
whales
yourself
you
will
doubt
struck
the
tremendous
amount
sound
created
the
body
the
animals
pounding
the
water
surface
now
consider
that
sound
travels
about
faster
through
water
than
does
through
air
and
that
water
also
conducts
sound
signals
better
than
air
the
sense
that
sound
signals
not
degrade
quickly
liquid
medium
such
seawater
they
gaseous
medium
such
air
not
unreasonable
think
that
when
whale
breaching
that
other
whales
possibly
tens
miles
away
could
hearing
the
sounds
produced
this
activity
there
have
been
many
times
when
are
watching
whale
that
suddenly
becomes
active
and
then
observe
splashes
the
distance
short
time
later
from
other
whales
that
didn
even
know
where
the
area
seems
these
whales
heard
the
activity
the
whale
that
were
observing
and
then
answered
back
performing
similar
activity
this
would
lend
credence
the
idea
that
the
activity
means
communicating
with
other
whales
this
perhaps
why
tend
see
breaching
more
regularly
rough
weather
the
sound
wind
and
waves
the
water
surface
get
louder
breaching
may
way
overcome
the
noise
and
keep
contact
with
other
whales
the
area
but
what
are
they
trying
say
well
one
knows
for
sure
like
make
analogy
however
and
say
that
similar
shouting
humans
imagine
aliens
came
down
earth
and
asked
you
why
people
shout
you
might
have
trouble
answering
that
question
decisively
because
people
shout
for
all
kinds
reasons
people
shout
when
they
are
angry
excited
frightened
when
they
are
trying
get
someone
attention
warn
then
some
impending
danger
when
they
are
trying
communicate
with
someone
who
far
away
other
words
people
shout
for
lots
reasons
and
the
reason
someone
shouting
depends
the
context
which
done
think
the
same
could
said
for
breaching
whales
whales
breach
for
lots
reasons
and
say
lots
different
things
but
could
translate
what
whale
was
saying
with
breach
would
typed
all
caps
and
have
exclamation
point
after
conclusion
one
knows
why
whales
exhibit
this
spectacular
behavior
they
probably
become
breach
for
all
these
reasons
listed
above
one
time
another
and
maybe
for
reasons
that
haven
even
occurred
yet
all
whale
watchers
can
hope
present
when
these
behaviors
occur

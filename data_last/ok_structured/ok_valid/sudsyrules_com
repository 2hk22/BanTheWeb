the
game
racquetball
although
considered
fairly
modern
invention
probably
has
its
roots
going
back
thousands
years
because
even
homer
day
games
were
played
with
balls
which
were
struck
the
hand
and
this
became
common
and
popular
sport
during
the
fifth
century
ireland
immigrants
brought
the
united
states
where
developed
into
the
american
sport
handball
but
legend
has
that
during
particularly
cold
winter
hitting
the
ball
with
the
hand
even
with
glove
was
too
painful
wooden
paddle
was
substituted
instead
and
the
game
paddle
ball
had
been
invented
eventually
gentleman
named
joe
sobek
who
made
his
living
playing
tennis
and
handball
decided
that
would
far
easier
for
people
learn
sport
which
covered
the
essentials
both
and
racquetball
was
invented
although
was
called
paddle
rackets
first
the
essential
differences
between
the
new
sport
and
the
older
ones
was
that
paddle
rackets
was
played
with
stringed
racket
which
made
possible
aim
the
ball
more
accurately
and
that
greater
velocity
than
the
wooden
paddle
unlike
tennis
the
walls
floor
and
even
ceiling
dependent
upon
local
rules
were
legal
playing
surfaces

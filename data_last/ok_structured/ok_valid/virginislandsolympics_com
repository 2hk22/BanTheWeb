members
the
virgin

sailing
team
participating
the
central
american
and
caribbean
games
veracruz
mexico
are
seeing
financial
effects
during
the
games
equipment
very
lacking
especially
for
what
paid
for
thompson
said
the
only
people
that
seem
have
nice
boats
are
the
ones
that
either
got
container
shipped
but
more
importantly
the
mexicans
who
have
brand
new
gear
every
class
that
sail
thompson
who
races
the
laser
class
said
the
boats
are
old
would
not
accept
one
was
given
him
cost
pointed
out
that
the
boat
rented
the
sailor
from
antigua
was
logged
with
what
seemed
like
gallons
water
when
asked
thinks
that
the
selective
distribution
equipment
possible
move
give
certain
teams
and
edge
replied
never
put
past
these
countries
thompson
speaks
from
experience
was
winner
cac
games
before
despite
the
equipment
issues
team
plans
sailing
victory
thompson
sailed
his
way
into
the
qualifications
for
the
olympic
games
scheduled
for
rio
janeiro
making
gold
fleet
spain
earlier
but
very
aware
that
preparing
for
high
level
competitions
bear
high
level
financial
considerations
the
hard
part
over
but
guess
the
next
obstacle
the
fundraising
keep
things
going
which
the
hardest
thing
thompson
said
according
thompson
guestimate
what
would
cost
for
his
equipment
and
travels
for
his
international
preparation
that
lot
money
know
but
stay
competitive
that
what
you
need
thompson
said
you
need
the
coaches
the
equipment
and
you
need
travel
the
events
like
the
big
regattas
that
just
the
way
thompson
feels
you
the
olympics
without
that
level
preparedness
you
just
showing
been
there
before
thompson
said
the
olympics
want
back
but
this
time
want
have
fighting
chance
laser
class
competitions
are
global
events
and
thompson
would
like
have
equipment
strategically
placed
key
sailing
areas
when
say
equipment
mean
just
being
able
have
boats
one
boat
rio
two
boats
the
and
one
boat
europe
when
there
don
have
keep
renting
thompson
said
thompson
has
the
backing
and
support
the
sailing
federation
but
all
other
members
tough
because
there
are
ton
athletes
ones
that
haven
qualified

need
their
federation
support

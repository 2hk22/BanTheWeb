can
begin
tell

just
how
happy
that
this

wheat
based
which
helps
balance
out
rahr
went
the
extra
step

bring
you

wintervention
has
nice

did
great
job
bringing
this

was
moderate
and
they
did
very
nice

myself
wish
their
was
little

local

microbreweries

their

almost
all
the
beer
their
taps
was
from
our
state
and
they
have
interesting
methodology
adding
gas
into
the
growler
prior
the
pour
that
keeps
the
beer
better
carbonated
longer
and
most
importantly
slows
the
beer
trip
flatsville
while
your
fridge
were
told
would
stay
fresh
for
long
weeks
your
home
like
those
odds
even
though
beer
ever
stays

for
weeks
unless
someone
brought
over
some
crap
and
left

then
will
forced

great
juxtaposition
the

across

which
flies
carelessly
every

what
liked
about
the

was
that
reminded

another
great

about
the

which
you
live
east

frequent
greenville
that

and
much
easier
than

waiting
suspicious
looking

get
your

the
unique
concept
what
separates
craft
and

from
just
about

town
the
ability
order
beer
you
come
grab
growler
off
the
wall
wooden
shelves
they
have
all
sorts
really
cool
ones
bring
your

and
they
will
fill
with
your
choice
micro

and
send
you
your

they
even
have
quick
spots
back
for
people
that
just
want

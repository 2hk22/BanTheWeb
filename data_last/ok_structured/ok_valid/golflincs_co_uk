true
that

the

stats
illustrate
the
fundamental
problem
facing

around
the

the
particularly
badly

with
massive

that
poses
real

although
some
see
this
good
for

certainly
not
good
for
the

you
may
say
that
with
their
current
standing
the
threat
from
the
new
providers
not
too
serious
but
they
will
grow
rapidly

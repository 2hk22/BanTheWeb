dreamed
nor
imagined
how
nostalgic
this
san
juan
island
trip
would
prove
our
hectic
stressful
micromanaged
city
lives
were
transformed
into
unique
magical
san
juan
adventure
that
brought
back
vivid
childhood
island
memories
simplicity
trust
friendship
connection
bonding
beauty
and
last
but
not
definitely
not
least
comfort
and
safety
you
recall
the
feeling
you
had
child
when
was
just
natural
play
and
run
laugh
and
squeal
when
you
had
doubts
fears
heavy
burdens
bear
was
was
coming
home
place
and
feeling
had
yearned
for
many
years
arrived
the
san
juans
islands
lummi
island
via
the
reliable
whatcom
chief
ferry
beautiful
sunny
summer
afternoon
late
july
there
feeling
that
almost
indescribable
the
lummi
island
ferry
maneuvers
its
way
across
the
scenic
channel
you
leaving
all
your
worries
and
stress
behind
and
immediately

peace
familiarity
combined
with
the

island
beauty
stopped
the
quaint
lummi
island
country
store
the
islander
our
way
our
rented
lummi
island
waterfront
vacation
home
had
chuckle
observed
one
the
locals
run
tab
the
last
time
recall
doing
this
was
grade
five
the
school
concession
small
hometown
turned
off
the
rural
lummi
island
road
enter
the
driveway
our
san
juan
island
home
away
from
home
was
astounded
the
incredible
panoramic
view
witnessed
was
surreal
and
was
spectacular
got
some
our
belongings
out
the
car
realized
how
easy
this
whole
process
had
been
thus
far
airports
airplanes
security
screenings
front
desks
lobbys
etc
etc
just
simply
walked
the
beautiful
front
door
our
san
juan
islands
rental
house
and
let
ourselves
into
place
that
was
our
lummi
islan
dream
home
for
week
elegant
tasteful
and
immaculate
yet
warm
cozy
and
inviting
and
included
every
amenity
and
special
touch
one
could
possibly
want
need
this
cape
cod
style
lummi
island
house
had
booked
sight
unseen
was
truly
spectacular
spacious
open
rooms
with
large
windows
and
incredible
san
juan
island
views
from
every
vantage
point
the
colors
furnishings
and
unique
west
coast
decorative
touches
blended
perfectly
with
the
style
and
feeling
our
home
stood
the
beautifully
landscaped
yard
and
gardens
that
overlooked
the
ocean
passage
below
hales
passage
and
portage
island
beyond
breathed
long
sigh
relief
sense
release
renewal
revival
rejuvenation
well
complete
pleasure
and
contentment
resonated
through
body
suddenly
old
daughter
squealed
with
joy
she
spotted
bob
the
resident
lummi
island
deer
who
had
been
told
would
surely
paying
visit
cautiously
and
graciously
wandered
across
the
lawn
looking
inquisitively
his
new
san
juan
island
family
for
the
week
been
advised
before
came
that
were
welcome
feed
bob
and
any
other
the
animals
that
sauntered
visit
feeding
bins
were
provided
and
neatly
stored
amazing
how
animals
bring
you
right
back
nature
effortlessly
short
hike
down
the
trail
the
high
bank
waterfront
led
the
beach
where
the
lumi
island
children
spent
the
remainder
the
afternoon
exploring
skipping
rocks
splashing
each
other
looking
for
crabs
and
just
basically
having
the
time
their
lives
doing
such
simple
things
truly
was
delightful
watching
and
interacting
with
children
they
played
environment
where
they
could
just
kids
uninhibited
and
child
like
again
mind
raced
back
memories
the
many
hours
spent
playing
and
frolicking
the
beach
with
family
our
summer
san
wan
island
vacations
later
the
day
all
decided
for
bike
ride
bikes
had
been
delivered
and
ready
for
around
what
lummi
island
locals
call
the
loop
cars
would
actually
slow
down
they
passed
give
smile
and
wave
how
long
had
been
since
had
witnessed
something
like
this
already
felt
part
the
island
community
and
barely
just
arrived
after
delicious
outdoor
barbeque
dinner
fresh
local
salmon
and
tasty
grilled
vegetables
all
delivered
before
arrived
our
fridge
might
add
all
decided

what
you
need
know
anion
gap
the
test
that
measures
the
difference
the
anions
and
the
cations
measured
the
blood
the
cations
are
the
positively
charged
ions
and
the
anions
being
the
negatively
charged
anions
the
extent
the

represents
the

usually
calculated

diabetes
calculating
anion
gap
could
done
two
ways
one
calculated
with
potassium
and
the
other
the
calculation
without

when
calculating
anion
gap
with
potassium
the
serum
concentrations
chloride
and
bicarbonate
are
subtracted
from
the
sodium
and
potassium
concentrations
while
calculating
the
anion
gap
without
potassium
which
the
way
popularly
accepted
due
the
fact
that
the
concentration
potassium
too
low
have
any
significant
effect
the
calculated

omitted
from

sodium

calcium
and
magnesium
are
some
the
very
common
cations
that
are

some
the
cations
considered
unmeasured
are
few
serum

that
normally
occur
and
some
other

that
are
pathological
nature
similarly
anions
that
are
commonly
measured
include
chloride
bicarbonate
and
phosphate
while
the
unmeasured
counterparts
are
sulfates
and
some
serum

several
diseases
calculating

has
gone
through
several
evolutions
and
there
new
and
old
system
classification
the
modern
method
involves
the
use
ion
selective
electrodes
giving
normal

less
than
meq
this
goes
say
that
high

anything
that

the
new
classification

therefore
established
being
within
the
prediction

previous
methods
measuring
the
anion
gap
comprised
colorimetry

this
means
that

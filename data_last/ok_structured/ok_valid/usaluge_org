was
something
weird
never
done
here
drifted
the
right
settled
into
the
sled
and
nicked
the
wall
was
bummed
right
away
because
knew
killed
all
time
but
was
lucky
with
the
weather
that
slowed
the
track
for
some
the
better
guys
and
kept
the
mix
had
great
second
run

can
fast
times
but
struggling
little
bit
the

really
close
really
bummed
with
how
the
very
end
the
season
turned
out
with
the
crash
altenberg

then
missing
the

that
one
would
find
this
region
near
the
black
sea

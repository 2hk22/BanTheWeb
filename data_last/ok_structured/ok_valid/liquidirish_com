article
takes
sides
the
spelling
question
label
irish
whiskey
irish
whisky
according
your
like
dislike
the
letter
think
that
mistake
yes
know
that
until
little
more
than
three
decades
ago
the
non
variant
still
had
some
currency
ireland
paddy
whisky
was
the
last
holdout
but
then
the
one
remaining
distiller
the
island
standardised
whiskey
and
every
irish
whiskey
brand
since
then
has
embraced
the
convention
wonderful
accidental
gift
marketers
that
should
not
lightly
relinquished
those
the
distilling
business
forget
think
how
mysterious
and
intimidating
whiskey
the
uninitiated
what
made
from
how
you
turn
grain
into
alcohol
what
does
age
statement
mean
what
the
difference
between
bourbon
and
scotch
and
the
one
tidbit
knowledge
that
people
around
the
world
find
easy
latch
that
scotland
spells
whisky
but
ireland
prefers
whiskey
the
not
thing
appears
myriad
forms
the
headlines
hundreds
articles
immediately
establishes
that
irish
whiskey
somehow
distinct
from
scotch
and
beachhead
from
which
the
curious
can
strike
out
explore
new
landscape
there
are
already
those
the
irish
distilling
game
plotting
erase
this
fortunate
distinction
peter
mulryan
blackwater
distillery
has
declared
for
the
opposing
side
everything
says
that
article
correct
yes
pure
marketing
but
that
more
than
enough
reason
preserve
the
related
topic
would
like
commend
the
hidden
hand
who
added
this
line
the
technical
file
the
customary
term
for
the
plural
irish
whiskey
irish
whiskeys
yes
not
whiskies
that
would
the
plural
whisky
this
shouldn
news
anyone
are
just
following
the
most
routine
conventions
english
but
regularly
stuffed
all
the
distilleries
press
releases
and
other
marketing
bumph
the
irish
times
gets
wrong
the
irish
whiskey
society
gets
wrong
often
see
both
whiskies
and
whiskeys
the
same
piece
which
proves
not
conscious
choice
just
carelessness
choose
whisky
whiskey
when
you
pick
your
pen
but
whichever
one
you
select
would
you
please
confine
yourself
the
correct
corresponding
plural

irish
whiskey
the
technical
file
part
until
now
been
making
with
the
irish
whiskey
act
know
what
and
isn
irish
whiskey
has
the
merit
being
quick
read
but
comes
from
era
when
there
was
only
one
distilling
company
the
whole
island
and
weren
shifting
much
the
wet
stuff
not
much
nit
picking
over
definitions
back
then
today
have
dozens
operating
and
aspiring
distillers
and
irish
whiskey
coining
globally
have
something
worth
protecting
and
nurturing
competitive
world
and
that
means
shoring
the
legal
underpinnings
the
useful
here
confers
geographical
indication
status
many
europe
distinctive
regional
food
and
drink
products
provides
means
protect
against
knock
offs
other
member
countries
and
via
trade
agreements
much
the
rest
the
world
irish
whiskey
status
comes
with
requirement
for
technical
file
that
details
terminology
ingredients
and
production
practices
one
the
first
tasks
the
irish
whiskey
association
formed
just
last
year
was
hammer
out
this
document
with
input
from
industry
players
the
department
agriculture
adds
the
imprimateur
the
irish
state
and
submits
the
file
the
been
reading
this
recently
completed
technical
file
and
have
picked
out
some
highlights
there
plenty
say
spread
over
few
articles
disclaimer
this
interpretation
the
new
rules
open
correction
what
isn
new
one
sense
nothing
has
changed
you
follow
the
recipe
the
irish
whiskey
act
you
will
end
with
something
you
are
still
entitled
call
irish
whiskey
what
new
various
sub
categories
irish
whiskey
have
been
defined
for
the
first
time
these
are
already
general
use
and
are
broadly
understood
but
the
definitions
include
some
welcome
clarifications
let
have
look
irish
pot
still
whiskey
whiskey
terminology
often
confusing
but
irish
pot
still
whiskey
seems
particularly
perverse
not
simply
irish
whiskey
made
pot
still
were
then
malt
whiskey
would
pot
still
whiskey
but
isn
cooley
tried
that
one
few
years
ago
general
disapproval
there
was
half
hearted
legal
definition
until
but
general
neither
very
useful
nor
very
accurate
midleton
the
only
distillery
currently
bottling
pot
still
whiskey
and
also
heir
some
the
great
pot
still
producing
distilleries
former
years
the
new
definition
doubt
owes
much
their
knowledge
both
current
and
historic
practice
now
know
that
pot
still
whiskey
must
contain
minimum
malted
barley
and
minimum
unmalted
barley
can
other
cereals
such
oats
and
rye
seems
low
but
don
think
this
stifles
innovation
since
you
can
use
whatever
grain
mashbill
you
like
within
the
terms
the
act
and
still
call
irish
whiskey
just
not
necessarily
irish
pot
still
whiskey
irish
pot
still
whiskey
batch
distilled
usually
large
pot
stills
don
know
why
they
bothered
with
this
qualification
since
doesn
preclude
small
stills
makes
supposedly
neutral
document
look
little
midleton
skewed
large

contribute
unique
range
reflux
ratios
that
lead
the
formation
distinct
flavour
and

profile
the
spirit
pre
emptive
dig
new
smaller
competitors
expected
little
more
clarity
still
type
here
because
some
the
new
producers
have
apparently
been
getting
the
stink
eye
over
their
choice
hybrid
still
flexible
design
with
very
short

mounted
over

the
technical

silent
this
matter
now
here
surprise
pot

spirit
not
entirely
distilled
pot

the
technical
document
has
describe
actual
practice
and
turns
out
that
the
column
still
enjoys
minor
walk
part
this
sub
category
the
residues
left
behind
after
pot
distillation
may
contain
alcohol
column
still
can
efficiently
reclaim
that
alcohol
which
can
used
augment
subsequent
pot
distillation
sounds
like
pragmatic
measure
improve
the
energy
efficiency
the
whole
process
and
reduce
waste
all
for
that
the
file
allows
for
double
triple

and
while
notes
that
the

used
currently
unpeated
does
not

irish

here
malted
barley
specified
peated
unpeated
for
some
reason
the

comes
from
dedicated

companies
which
hardly
seems

reckon
that
statement
will
falsified
least
one
the
new

malting
its
own

irish

discover
that

the

deliberately

sunday
march
the
curse
accessibilty
irish
whiskey
taken
seriously
not
according
mark
reynier
speaking
the
spirits
business
recently
the
guy
converting
former
brewery
waterford
city
whiskey
distillery
don
think
people
take
irish
whiskey
seriously
because
there
isn
anything
with
which
take
seriously
easy
doing
accessible
stuff
but
there
isn
great
deal
mind
fuckery
going
all
just
pretty
simplistic
stuff
our
aim
the
put
some
meat
the
bones
and
actually
produce
some
serious
whiskey
gives
the
opportunity
challenge
pernod
ricard
ireland
and
create
significant
irish
whiskey
brand
with
whole
lot
extra
credibility
that
sometimes
missing
from
big
companies
there
plenty
there
disagree
with
and
inclined
with
nod
samuel
johnson
slap
bottle
redbreast
the
table
and
declare
refute
thus
agree
with
him
about
one
thing
though
irish
whiskey
has
perception
problem
and
not
just
among
our
foreign
comrades
here
bono
doing
bit
soul
searching
over
last
album
the
album
should
have
had
more
the
energy
the
musicians
and
those
who
inspired
bit
more
anarchy
bit
more
punk
didn
want
pastiche
the
era
put
all
those
and
early
eighties
influence
the
juicer
and
blend
emerged
more
like
irish
whiskey
than
single
malt
like
many
whiskey
drinkers
ireland
and
elsewhere
bono
using
single
malt
synonym
for
both
scotch
and
quality
whiskey
and
antonym
for
irish
whiskey
not
singling
out
bono
this
usage
common
ireland
the
news
has
yet
trickle
out
that
produce
our
own
quality
single
malts
along
with
single
pot
stills
that
can
stand
toe
toe
with
anything

think
this
lack
regard
stems
from
the
irish
whiskey
industry
own
marketing
script
that
word
that
damns
with
faint
praise
accessible
mark
reynier
used
pejoratively
above
but
routinely
introduce
our
own
whiskey
easy
drinking
approachable
accessible
sounds
like
positive
attribute
but
really
code
for
not
peated
like
that
dreadful
scotch
there
are
smooth
sweet
unpeated
scottish
whiskies
but
you
are
not
into
sucking

you
are

you
order
blindly
from

even
connemara
ireland
peaty
whiskey
only
lightly
and
sweet
gently
smoky
malt
with
wide
appeal
the
accessibility
irish
whiskey
historical
accident
nothing
mandates
the
general
exclusion
peat
from
irish
whiskey
triple
distillation
sometimes
gets
equal
billing
for
upping
the
smooth
factor
but
that
not
requirement
either
cooley
range
has
always
been
double
distilled
for

the
accessibility
tag
served
purpose
which
was

huge
quantities
blended
whiskeys
now
that
are
trying
showcase
the
best
non
blended
irish
spirits
millstone
the
industry
went
through
this
before
when
irish
whiskey
became
kitchen
ingredient
reserved
for
making
irish
coffee
what
seemed
like
great
wheeze
for
flogging
bottles
hobbled
subsequent
efforts
expand
the
market
the
time
has
come
stop
defining
irish
whiskey
what

can
stand
its

merits
well

irish
whiskey
smoother

walsh
whiskey
announced
this
week
that
duggan
lynch
kilkenny
will
building
their
new
distillery
royal
oak
completion
spring
the
plan
though
the
spirit
should
already
flowing
from
late
the
company
continues
the
meantime
dip
into
irish
distillers
warehouses
for
its
writers
tears
and
irishman
brands
this
year
usual
are
treated
new
cask
strength
version
each
they
come
with
very
similar
descriptions
vatting
single
pot
still
and
single
malt
all
triple
distilled
and
aged
bourbon
casks
they
are
non
chill
filtered
and
bottled
cask
strength
for
the
writers
tears
for
the
irishman
was
unable
prise
precise
details
composition
from
the
company
let
speculate
little
understanding
that
writers
tears
cask
strengths
contain
more
pot
still
than
malt
this
reversed
for
the
irishman
cask
strength
from
the
number
bottles
produced
going
guess
that
casks
were
emptied
for
the
writers
tears
bottles
perhaps
pot
still
and
malt
there
are
more
bottles
the
irishman
which
suggests
casks
malt
and
pot
still
last
year
tried
the
editions
side
side
and
had
definite
preference
for
the
irishman
this
year
writers
tears
has
purely
personal
preference
others
will
disagree
had
chance
get
know
the
writers
tears
quite
well
thanks
the
kindness
walsh
whiskey
not
the
oak
and
vanilla
hit
might
expect
from
the
bourbon
casks
lot
more
savoury
which
appeals
greatly
the
nose
oily
tarred
rope
with
touch
eucalyptus
the
taste
quite
spicy
initially
but
levels
out
digestive
biscuits
the
long
finish
reaching
for
that
vanilla
and
oak
but
not
quite
getting
there
instead
fading
out
notes
unripe
banana
and
raisin
like
sweetness
there
something
else
the
mix
can
put
finger
something
vegetal
rate
the
writers
tears
cask
strength
very
highly
been
both
interesting
and
very
satisfying

time

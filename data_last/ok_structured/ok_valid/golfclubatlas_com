general
the

fall
into
one
four
distinct
architectural
periods
pre

only
one
two
days
site
stake
out
the
tees
and
greens
they
made
few
decisions
they
didn
have
the
ability
move
much
land
however
the
lesson
learned
from
studying
the
works
the
old
town
morris
and
the
like
timeless
nature
opposed
money
provides
the
most
enduring
challenges
architects
began
move
and
shape
land
create
hazards
and
add
strategic
interest
such
work
originated
with
the
heathland
courses
outside
london
and
men
like
charles

brought

coined
the

modern
architects
have
unprecedented
options

the
land
the
mid
architects
manufactured
courses
with
immense
visual
impact

that
often

surprisingly
the
most
successful

they

without

golf

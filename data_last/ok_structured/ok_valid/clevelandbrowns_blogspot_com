team
today
saturday
january
off
season
overview
about
now
that
the
browns
decision
makers
should
done
evaluating
the
season
and
roster
they
know
their
own
strengths
and
liabilities
now
matter
strategy
which
their
own
dozen
plus
potential
free
agents
should
they
try
sign
who
are
their
top
targets
around
the
league
when
free
agency
kicks
off
march
how
much
their
abundant
salary
cap
space
are
they
willing
spend
which
positions
are
deep
the
draft
and
which
prospects
project
best
for
the
brown
and
orange
who
might
they
trade
for
and
trade
away
yesterday
focused
the
browns
top
three
positions
that
need
attention
and
here
the
rough
landscape
for
the
next
three
units
buttress
wide
receiver
seemed
telling
that
the
first
player
new
offensive
coordinator
john
defilippo
mentioned
his
introductory
press
conference
that
excited
coach
was
josh
gordon
the
mega
talented
but
enigmatic
wideout
was
thought
all
but
out
the
door
after
the
team
suspended
him
for
the
final
game
but
they
were
intent
sending
him
packing
the
incoming
wouldn
quick
drop
his
name
like
that
gordon
leash
may
shorter
than
ever
but
the
potential
upside
him
returning
form
outweighs
the
benefit
cutting
bait
just
yet
still
just
fewer
than
current
browns
are
older
and
the
two
suspensions
last
season
deprive
him
becoming
ufa
after
the
coming
year
though
gordon
expected
contest
that
while
his
potential
immense
there
way
the
browns
can
rely
flash
the
focal
point
the
offense
ray
farmer
tends
downplay
the
importance
investing
premiere
receivers
but
clearly
more
options
are
needed
first
thing
sign
miles
austin
for
another
year
was
clutch
target
last
year
and
mature
presence
even
after
his
season
ending
injury
beyond
that
cleveland
has
three
bantamweights
andrew
hawkins
taylor
gabriel
and
travis
benjamin
they
each
can
continue
contribute
though
benjamin
value
depends
reestablishing
himself
reliable
returner
marlon
moore
played
mostly
special
teams
unsigned
for
and
going
seems
unlikely
back
three
other
developmental
players
phil
bates
kevin
cone
and
rodney
smith
each
have
size
and
will
compete
for
roster
spots
that
still
leaves
pretty
glaring
need
even
the
flaky
gordon
and
injury
prone
austin
return
time
add
another
viable
option
probably
via
the
draft
had
they
kept
charles
johnson
last
fall
might
not
saying
that
offensive
line
last
year
line
was
outstanding
until
center
alex
mack
broken
leg
exposed
disheartening
lack
depth
should
return
his
fine
form
for
least
one
more
season
after
which
could
opt
out
his
contract
and
hit
the
market
the
left
side
remains
quite
solid
with
perennial
pro
bowler
joe
thomas
entering
his
ninth
season
tackle
and
joel
bitonio
quickly
establishing
himself
fine
find
guard
right
guard
veteran
john
greco
was
reliable
and
made
one
pine
for
shawn
lauvao
right
tackle
mitchell
schwartz
has
now
started
all
games
his
career
and
heads
into
his
contract
year
love
see
how
his
evaluation
went
may
challenged
michael
bowie
who
started
eight
games
for
the
seahawks
and
perhaps
reasonably
high
draft
pick
the
mack
experience
was
eye
opening
and
the
falloff
should
thomas
ever
get
hurt
would
similarly
tragic
surprised
they
see
the
durable
but
inconsistent
schwartz
pillar
this
team
long
term
others
the
mix
include
disappointing
vet
paul
mcquistan
fill
ins
nick
mcdonald
and
ryan
seymour
and
prospects
vinston
painter
andrew
mcdonald
and
karim
barton
secondary
the
defensive
backfield
was
the
browns
best
unit
last
year
with
three
players
earning
pro
bowl
honors
corner
joe
haden
and
safeties
donte
whitner
and
tashaun
gipson
much
maligned
buster
skrine
also
played
well
overall
the
other

corner
with
haden
the
other
side
gets
attacked

probably
commits
too
many
penalties

are

sanchez
jake

the
eagles
look
elsewhere
seem
worth
considering
even
expect
the

another

who
and
which
slot
that
will
surely
storyline
follow
into

headed
into
the
last

their
rookie
contracts
phil
taylor
billy

ought
considered
for
new
deals
before
next

injuries
aside
taylor
hasn
played
his
first
round
potential
armonty
bryant
was
intriguing
pass
rush
threat
before
his
acl
tear
his
rehab
and
the
development
calvin
barnett
and
jaccobi
mcdaniel
will
telling
terms

one
impact
player
would
fit
really
well
but
very
reluctant
open
the

for
the
soon
lion

tight

the
big
question
whether
former
pro

and
ufa
jordan

will
return
one
hand
would
shame
lose
him
after
the
years
invested
his

sure
handed
big

threat
that
defenses
must
respect
but
also
concussion
prone
the
browns
were
right
let
brodney

walk
five
years

and
could
understand
they
won
pay
premium
this
time
either
hope
works
out
for
him
return
otherwise
becomes
serious
need
jim
dray

are
nice
complementary
players
who
back
but
doubt
the
scouts
shopping
list
has
tight

near
the
top
other

ranked
decreasing

need
wide

offensive

better
record
but
team
the
rise
once
again
the
browns
have
finished
losing
season
tailspin
dropping
their
last
five
games
they
led
the
afc
north
late
november
but
now
the
rest
the
division
headed
for
the
playoffs
and
the
browns
are
headed
for
another
tumultuous
off
season
unlike
the
past
two
years
the
head
coach
and
general
manager
will
stay
according
owner
jimmy
haslam
the
new
mike
pettine
ray
farmer
regime
produced
three
game
improvement
over
which
ended
with
the
scapegoating
rookie
head
coach
rob
chudzinski
and
after
prolonged
search
for
successor
the
eventual
firing
ceo
joe
banner
and
his
henchman
mike
lombardi
the
sole
rationale
haslam
provided
for
chud
firing
was
this
what
would
say
that
really
important
that
show
improvement
during
the
course
the
season
specifically
talked
about
believe
you
look
back
the
quote
needed
better
the
last
three
games
than
were
the
first
three
games
the
season
developed
and
what
was
really
nice
start
and
got
later
into
the
season
was
our
feeling
that
team
were
not
getting
better
yes
had
young
team
but
think
reflect
would
all
say
young
team
should
get
better
and
simply
didn
feel
like
that
was
happening
but
that
was
year
ago
does
this
season
ending
did
with
some
serious
skid
marks
represent
substantial
progress
and
cause
for
hope
that
certainly
debatable
but
history
can
provide
some
context
ten
other
times
nfl
history
team
followed
season
going
what
happened
next
their
combined
records
the
next
season
were
which
means
the
average
record
for
team
that
went
the
previous
year
and
before
that
just
and
that
rounding
here
are
those
ten
teams
most
recent
first
team
changed

what

steelers
think

for

you
may
have

the
browns
yesterday
dismantled
the

their
largest

are
several
storylines
interest
here
from
the
satisfaction
convincing

the

ending
broken

center
alex
mack
the
gritty
performance
the
hobbled

harried

the
prospect
continuing
this
roll
against
three
subpar
opponent
the
immediate
horizon
not
get
ahead
ourselves
but
the
browns
should
favored
over
the
jaguars
raiders
and
buccaneers
combined
record
they
convert
they
heading

crucial
thursday

cincinnati
then
they

who
like

considerable

some

assuming
west
satisfies
the
coaches
with
improved
attitude
and
pass
blocking
return
complete
the
most
balanced
and
productive
tailback
ensemble
many
years
they
averaging
yards

which
puts
them
pace
for
for
the
season
not
since
jim
brown
peak
year
have
three
browns
combined
for
many
rushing
yards
all
three
them
are
decisive
and
powerful
good
fits
for
kyle
shanahan
zone
blocking
one
cut
approach
each
has
his
strengths
and
weaknesses
tate
the
veteran
has
good
vision
the
open
field
and
shifty
enough
threaten
the
second
level
defenders
but
had
injury
problems
throughout
his
pro
career
and
his
smallish
hands
make
him
less
than
ideal
receiver
and
fumble
risk
ten
games
over
three
years
houston
crowell
flies
off

with
very
strong

use
that

more
viable
option

while
the

high
none

preferred

the
passing

rookie
fullback
ray

deserves
credit
for
some
strong

may
their
best

protector
the
backfield
the
trio
has
totaled
just
six
catches
for
yards
mostly
west
agnew
been
targeted
five
times
with
just
one
reception
this
indicates
that
the

glide

interesting
see
west

winston

how
much
the
loss
mack

will
hurt
and
whether
the
browns
continue
keep
their
stable
fresh
and
hungry
with
balanced

hard
argue
with
this
kind
success
the
browns
rushing

taking

from

associated
press
feature
just
stand
near
them
and
listen
them
talk
said
first
year
coach
mike
pettine
they
football
nerds
that
all
they
talk
about
football
they
get
into
some
real
depth
conversations
about
and
shows
the
field
they
work
very
well
together
very
intelligent
group
and
think
they
very
well
suited
for
the
scheme
the
scheme
under
new
offensive
coordinator
kyle
shanahan
the
browns
switched
zone
blocking
scheme
this
season
can
complicated
system
learn
with
many
details
and
nuances
pettine
and
his
staff
knew
would
take
time
for
the
browns
offensive
line
become
comfortable
with
something
foreign
they
expected
steep
learning
curve
this
group
though
flattened
quickly
pettine
said
didn
expect
the
line
come
far
this
quickly
but
when
you
look
the
group
and
just
how
smart
they
are
and
how
hard
they
work
and
the
way
they
get
coached
looking
back
not
huge
surprise
pettine
said
fox
news
picked
the
piece
and
put
under
headline
that
began
not
blockheads
the
team
house
mouthpiece
also
touted
the
starting
five
this
week
the
cleveland
browns
offensive
line
manhandling
opposing
defenses
through
the
first
four
games
the
season
this
isn
fluke
this
who
they
are
they
haven
just
gelled
together
they
are
together
one
and
the
well
regarded
analytics
site
pro
football
focus
just
came
out
with
their
league
wide
offensive
line
rankings
the
browns
graded
out
the
very
top
rare
the
stars
align
like
this
you
got
five
players
who
have
played
every
snap
and
look
like
line
sync
these
plaudits
are
certainly
well
deserved
but
the
risk
pooping
the
punchbowl
there
something
interesting
behind
all
this
talk
special
star
alignment
unified
group
very
intelligent
quick
learners
front
ahead
and
say
they
all
white
guys
not
that
there
anything
wrong
with
that
and
far
from
imply
that
ray
farmer
roster
reflects
systematic
bias
but
the
particular
language
used
discuss
this
group
echoes
certain
pre
existing
identity
related
narratives
you
disagree
point
out
profiles
some
mixed
race
offensive
lines
that
similarly
emphasize
for
example
their
depth
conversations
about
football
and
their
togetherness
one
now
the
math
demographic
study
the
nfl
opening
man

provides
data
the
racial
composition
the
teams
and
the
various
positions
few
fast
facts
players
are
white
black
players
are
the
majority
but
earn
less

than
any
other

the

order
long

kicker
punter
center
quarterback
tight

and
guard
offensive
linemen
are
white
compared
just
defensive

even
given
the
relative
prevalence
white
offensive
linemen
the
browns
situation
rare
the
odds
that
random
draw
one
center
two
guards
and
two
tackles
from
the
current
nfl
population
would
result
five
white

just
quick
look

around
the

shows
that
cleveland
the
only
team
with
all
white

across
the

you
include
the
tight

counting
just
the

aside
from
the

only
jacksonville
and
perhaps
green

depending
whether

this
all
just
observation
not
accusation
racial
attitudes
and
aptitudes
opportunities
and
obstacles
well
all
fraught
with
complexity
and
conflict
why

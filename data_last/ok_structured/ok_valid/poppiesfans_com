play
off
hopefuls
barton
rovers
saturday
complete
the
first
their
last
three
league
fixtures
the
battle
for
play
off
places
looking
like
being
very
tight
contest
and
will
probably
down
the
wire
for
the
six
clubs
still
the
hunt
barton
rovers
currently
occupy
spot
point
above
placed
bedworth
after
rovers
lost
home
monday
and
bedworth
won
away
close
the
gap
ironically
kettering
then
host
bedworth

their
final
home
game
the
season
next
saturday
nice
touch
from
barton
rovers
are
the
champions
played
the
players
take
the
field
for
this
afternoon
encounter
sunshine
bathed
sharpenhoe
the
home
side
settles
quicker
barnes
skips
past
hull
and
knight
forced
make
good
save
the
opening
minutes
rovers
easily
having
the
lion
share
possession
and
chances
the
first
half
hour
but
kettering
still
level
terms
and
trying
gradually
work
their
way
into
the
match
barnes
booked
for
foul
mulligan
which
swung
over
the
wall
but
doesnt
trouble
the
barton
keeper
hall
nips
defender
slips
but
its
very
poor
strike
and
again
the
home
goal
isn
troubled
its
been
fairly
quiet
first
from
kettering
but
after
the
early
dominance
from
the
home
side
they
have
started
find
openings
the
rovers
defence
and
are
just
looking
for
that
final
third
quality
ball
half
time
barton
rovers
kettering
town
goal
the
second
half
gets
underway
and
barton
the
attack
again
but
the
poppies
defence
alert
the
danger
and
clear
field
kettering
win
free
kick
which
captain
steve
kinninburgh
steps
take
curls
superb
ball
round
the
defence
and
off
the
post
from
yards
out
make
great
start
the
second
minutes
and
honest
something
was
needed
bring
this
game
life
and
for
the
poppies
least
shook
them
out
their
earlier
malaise
barton
pressing
recover
from
that
poppies
goal
first
barnes
plays
sawyer
but
his
effort
held
well

and
then

collects
well
from

final

gooding
floats
good
pass
over
hall
but
the
keeper
again
denies
the
poppies
winger
increasing
the
one
goal
gap
between
the
two
teams
forster
has
been
busy
late
denying
kettering
opportunities
but
the
rovers
shot
stopper
arguably
fault
fails
recover
dropped
ball
and
the
fourth
attempt
steve
kinninburgh
hand
poke
the
ball
into
the
empty
net
great
pressure
from
kettering
not
letting
and
they
now
lead
with
minutes
gone
into
the
final
ten
minutes
with
barton
rovers
looking
likely
take
hit
their
play
off
hopes
trailing
kettering
but
perhaps
the
poppies
can
them
favour
their
next
fixture
home
bedworth
utd
kolodynsji
curls
good
effort
which
forster
tips
over
and
the
resulting
corner
easily
cleared
rovers
normal
time
now
and
into
mins
stoppage
time
with
kettering
looking
fairly
commanding
having
cushion
and
the
home
side
looking
little
forlorn
hall
shoots
wide
kettering
really
pressing
the
rovers
goal
both
kolodynski
and
ogbonna
have
decent
chances
but
forster
working
overtime
keep
the
score
down
this
second
half
the
final
whistle
goes
and
kettering
end
fairly
comfortable
winners
despite
the
early

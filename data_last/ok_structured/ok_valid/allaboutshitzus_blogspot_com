tuesday
january
winter
booties
boys
not
like
winter
they
not
like
the
cold
nor
they
like
snow
worry
about
their
little
feet
bought
some
dog
booties
for
them
wear
when
they
out
temperatures
here
can
cold
not
pretty
when
you
think
going
out
bare
feet
the
booties
are
made
for
little
dogs
they
are
black
felt
material
and
have
velcro
strap
that
allows
you
tighten
them
the
dog
foot
armed
with
new
buy
went
grab
bruiser
who
refused
sit
still
put
the
booties
because
bruiser
the
daredevil
the
two
will
leap
from
chairs
your
arms
because
thinks
can
fly
decided
rocki
was
the
safer
bet
try
the
booties
got
him
lap
and
proceeded
put
the
first
bootie
when
was
done
allowed
him
walk
could
gauge
had
right
obviously
was
not
tight
enough
the
first
thing
did
was
run
away
grab
the
bootie
his
teeth
and
yank
off
and
then
proceeded
beat
the
crap
out
shook
pawed
growled
and
then
shook
some
more
would
not
come
near
again
getting
booties
them
was
wasted
effort
tried
again
this
winter
luck
you
can
guess
the
doggie
sweaters
bought
are
nothing
more
than
new
irritant
that
they
would
rather
beat
that
wear

thursday
august
ear
infection
finally
gone
little
bruiser
has
always
had
some
form
yeast
infection
his
ear
got
sick
and
tired
taking
him
the
vet
get
antibiotics
only
find
the
ear
infection
clear
for
couple
weeks
and
then
come
back
thanks
local
groomer
have
found
better
solution
something
simple
apple
cider
vinegar
was
told
put
some
spray
bottle
and
quick
spritz
his
ear
first
couldn
find
bottle
took
cotton
ball
and
dipped
the
vinegar
usually
bruiser
very
sensitive
anything
his
ear
will
yelp
nip
but
when
applied
never
flinched
did
notice
that
the
vinegar
dries
the
ear
out
and
makes
itchy
bought
tube
zincofax
and
rubbed
his
ear
that
took
away
the
itch
has
finally
stopped
scratching
his
ears
and
constantly
shaking
his
head

thursday
march
being
responsible
for
your
pet
when
moved
small
town
immediately
built
fence
around
the
house
our
dogs
had
place
run
without
disturbing
others
and
without
worrying
about
other
dogs
and
assorted
critters
getting
into
the
yard
was
just
what
responsible
pet
owner
does
you
keep
your
pet
your
yard
this
town
however
didn
realize
that
dogs
were
such
huge
issue
seemed
that
many
people
had
dogs
however
they
were
allowed
roam
all
over
town
and
whatever
they
wanted
many
people
were
fed
with
this
particularly
with
some
the
large
dogs
who
would
not
described
friendly
one
older
lady
was
going
for
walk
and
was
cornered
one
loose
dog
she
was
rescued
local
storeowner
who
chased
the
dog
away
there
was
another
dog
big
german
shepherd
who
was
not
friendly
chased
cars
and
people
and
lives
right
next
the
school
they
found
evidence
her
wandering
the
school
grounds
and
chasing
little
kids
the
real
fear
came
when
she
had
pups
and
became
even
more
aggressive
right
next
the
school
many
town
people
were
complaining
there
was
bylaw
about
the
dogs
but
one
seemed
doing
anything
enforce
couldn
get
past
the
town
secretary
who
kept
telling
was
our
responsibility
contact
the
dog
owner
and
deal
with
even
though
the
bylaw
said
different
the
end
group
got
together
and
went
the
next
town
council
meeting
demand
that
something
done
and
was
not
only
got
the
council
begin
enforcing
the
bylaw
but
got
them
amend
say
could
use
picture
evidence
dog
the
loose
town
and
got
them
the
fine
from
amazing
how
fast
money
talks
overnight
all
the
lax
pet
owners
immediately
found
ways
keep
their
dogs
their
yards
you
know
the
sad
part
all
this
was
that
people
were
shooing
the
dogs
and
aiming
their
cars
the
ones
the
road
but
was
never
the
fault
the
animal
was
the
fault
the
owners
one
particular
had
beautiful
well
tempered
little
cross
breed
who
was
always
allowed
run
free
and
usually
hung
out
the
road
don
know
how
many
times
she
was
almost
hit
car
she
was
always
left
outside
one
ever
paid
any
attention
her
and
all
this
little
pooch
wanted
was
some
love
she
would
pee
whenever
she
saw
because
she
was
excited
and
knew
that
she
would
get
nice
belly
rub
and
lots
affection
one
the
councillors
and
used
plot
how
could
find
her
good
home
kidnap
her
from
the
road
and
take
her
loving
place
even
went
far
discreetly
speak
people
from
nearby
towns
see
they
wanted
this
sweet
little
dog
the
end
not
have
problem
with
dogs
there
lot
bitching
and
grumping
about
the
new
bylaw
but
the
bottom
line
you
have
pet
you
need
take
responsibility
for
that
means
caring
for
giving
affection
taking
the
vet
and
ensuring
that
your
pet
stays
your
property
for
the
safety
others
and
the
dog
own
safety

tuesday
november
what
lonely
boy
when
husband
and
first
started
our
restaurant
thought
had
plenty
time
zip
back
home
and
with
the
boys
how
wrong
were
unfortunately
fortunately
our
restaurant
took
off
and
were
deluged
with
people
our
private
time
was
extinguished
and
time
alone
with
our
boys
became
thing
the
past
try
and
make
home
couple
times
day
let
them
out
and
with
them
but
been
really
hard
call
make
money
while
can
have
better
life
hold
off
bit
and
spend
time
with
the
boys
actually
elected
spend
more
money
staff
can
come
home
and
with
the
little
guys
but
balancing
time
and
budget
becomes
more
difficult
the
days
did
make
the
right
move
not
sure
yet
but
doubt
the
boys
think
did
good
successful
yes
are
taught
but
looking
back
wish
times
had
elected
make
less
and
live
more
tough
call
for
anyone
business
for
themselves

scottish
season
equaling
the
number
days
rode
scotland
last
year
including
days
out
season
easter
sunday
saw
the
sunshine
and
the
crowds
the
queues
weren
too
bad
especially
single
could
jump
the
line
the
drag
lifts
flypaper
spring
run
and
the
wall
were
all
done
under
persistent
sunshine
the
snow
became
quite
heavy
but
great
fun
there
was
great
vibe
the
air
the
played
tunes
from
the
cafe
sun
deck
and
everyone
chilled
and
got
tan
real
shirt
day
today
the
easter
bunny
was
doing
the
rounds
skis
usual
leaving
chocolate
treats
around
the
hill
all
main
runs
still
open
hopefully
for

more
weeks

the

finally
part
the
last
run
the
day
day
scottish
season
made
early
start
and
was
the
hill
glencoe
mountain
resort
before
during
the
week
had
been
snowing
heavily
had
warmed
and
the
snow
was
wet
and
heavy
was
fun
though
main
basin
was
great
but
one
the
best
runs
was
happy
valley
through
the
narrows
and
then
onto
the
wall
spring
run
provided
great
sport
too
but
the
bottom
suffered
dead
leg
someone
collided
into
from
behind
jarring
knee
the
process
managed
ride
this
off
however
conditions
were
warm
and
visibility
poor
mist
hung
onto
the
top
the
mountain
there
still
fantastic
covering
snow
and
all
runs
are
open
bar
etive
and
rannoch
glades
right
the
end
the
day
the
top
the
spring
run
the
clouds
finally
parted
for
the
final
run
the
day
glencoe
march
march
ruanaich
snow
was
falling
all
levels
day
scottish
season
just
afternoon
but
worth
the
drive
was
adventure
itself
leaving
from
campbeltown
there
was
white
dusting
the
hills
the
morning
left
just
after
would
take
over
hours
get
coe
but
was
keen
make
the
most
days
off
tomorrow
wasn
looking
good
according
the
weather
report
pulled
after
hour
tarbert
could
get
wifi
signal
the
harbour
glencoe
had
received
dump
snow
and
was
waiting
the
kintyre
peninsula
mostly
sea
level
but
the
road
gained
altitude
there
was
dusting
hail
and
the
odd
snow
flurry
once
passed
inveraray
the
snow
the
ground
became
more
obvious
the
time
was
tyndrum
there
was
snow
all
around
approaching
the
ski
hill
was
obvious
that
visibility
would
minimal
was
snowing
heavily
the
carpark
and
was
two
minds
whether
the
hill
not
was
quite
late
after
little
more
procrastinating
bit
the
bullet
and
made
for
the
chairlift
the
hill
was
quiet
and
the
ski
school
were
descending
was
going
there
was
ghost
town
feel
the
place
was
monday
after
all
one
was
the
wall
bar
went
one
was
the
main
basin
bar
went
anyway
could
see
some
lonely
figures
through
the
mist
least
wasn
alone
there
was
bit
wind
and
snow
was
still
falling
once
strapped
the
summit
dropped
main
basin
the
silence
was
stunning
deep
powder
snow
and
that
wonderful
bouncy
feeling
you
get
made
the
journey
worth
while
with
only
the
occasional
passer
was
often
the
only
person
riding
the
top
the
hill
surreal
and
slightly
uneasy
feeling
but
the
joy
riding
the
powder
far
outweighed
any
negatives
did
have
use
radar
points
and
even
descending
thrombosis
lost
all
sensation
and
slipped
couple
times
finishing
off
down
the
plateau
run
the
snow
got
wetter
and
once
the
chairlift
down
started
getting
quite
wet
what
afternoon
hoping
this
snow
sticks
around
the
current
forecast
saying
next
weekend
will
have
low
wind
speeds
the
snow
keeps
falling
predicted
then
could
all
time

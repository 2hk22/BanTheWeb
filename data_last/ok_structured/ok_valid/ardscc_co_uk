request
for
assistance
and
patience
was
great
see
such
big
turnout
the
first
club
race
with
ards
riders
taking
part
their
first
ever
cycling
competition
however
this
also
led
some
teething
issues
with
long
queue
sign
and
incorrect
time
due
mistaken
identity
the
finish
apologies
for
that
try
and
smooth
things
out
the
coming
weeks
here
are
some
suggestions
the
biggest
problem
the
time
keepers
face
trying
identify
riders
they
sprint
for
the
finish
line
each
rider
could
get
their
start
number
from
the
time
keeper
the
start
line
and
then
shout
this
number
they
cross
the
finish
line
that
would
really
help
the
latest
cycling
ireland
guidance
means
have
collect
ice
case
emergency
details
from
each
rider
this
makes
sense
but
takes
time
your
first
event
could
you
have
your
ice
details
your
name
and
contact
number
written
out
advance
that
you
can
just
hand
them
over
and
remember
needs
relative
friend
contact
number
giving
your
own
mobile
number
sort
defeats
the
point
and
finally
have
club
rule
that
says
all
riders
must
use
flashing
rear
red
light
club
time
trials
this
another
safety
improvement
that
all
agreed
the
agm
please
don
give
the
time
keepers
grief
not
having
one
tour
ards
sponsors
seesense
great
range
the
average
age
our
time
keepers
excluding
young
whippet
paul
robinson
over
they
appreciate
curly
hetchins
check
out
that
lug
work
over
the
latest
cervelo
and
can
probably
remember
ride
round
lough
neagh
the
late
more
clearly
than
last
week
club
race
please
bear
with
and
any
offers
help
spot
riders
the
finish
indeed
become
trainee
time
keeper
would
much
appreciated
thanks

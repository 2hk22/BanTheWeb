youthful
junior

hurling
side
sprinkled
with

travelled
ballinakill
open
their
achl
campaign
against
local
rivals
ballinakill
fine
morning
for
hurling
was
offer
from
the
weather
gods
gentle
breeze
and
little
sunshine
shone
down
the
pitch
the
game
was
delayed
the
harps
fizzle
out
after
strong
start
against
ballinakill
achl
senior
hurling
apr
the
harps
senior
hurlers
lost
out
neighbours
ballinakill
the
opening
round
the
league
saturday
april
credit
ballinakill
who
had
the
pitch
very
good
condition
and
with
fine
weather
both
sides
played
out
entertaining
match
playing
with
slight
breeze
behind
them
the
harps
got
off
good
start
going
five
points
the
minute
with
three
pointed
free
from
shane
donoghue
and
point
apiece
from
play
brian
dunne
and
eoin
clancy
looked
this
stage
like
the
harps
would
romp
easy
win
but
ballinakill
were
not
going
down
without
fight
however
and
stormed
back
into
the
match
hitting
without
reply
open
point
lead
nearing
half
time
pointed
free
from
donoghue
stopped
the
rot
but
four
point
deficit
and
facing
the
breeze
the
second
half
left
the
harps
with
mountain
climb
the
harps
management
changed
things
half
time
with
niall
brophy
replacing
conor
brophy
and
shane
fiztpatrick
moving
from
corner
forward
midfield
again
the
harps
opened
the
half
strongly
hitting
the
first
four
points
through
donoghue
shane
fitzpatrick
and
john
brophy
unfortunately
did
not
take
full
advantage
this
period
dominance
two
goal
chances
were
missed
before
ballinakill
opened
their
second
half
account
with
point
form
play
both
sides
upped
the
ante
now
scores
were
traded
strong
tackles
were
put
and
local
rivalry
threatened
boil
over
referee
pat
moran
issued
two
yellow
cards
and
this
seemed
cool
matters
somewhat
and
thankfully
both
sides
focused
hurling
another
delightful
point
from
john
brophy
and
long
range
effort
from
shane
fitzpatrick
kept
the
harps
within
touching
distance
but
with
eamon
jackman
reliable
ever
free
taking
duty
the
harps
were
struggling
level
the
game
with
five
minutes
play
and
point
separating
the
sides
the
harps
threw
everything
ballinakill
but
was
not
the
day
ballinakill
wrapped
the
league
points
with
further
two
pointed
frees
not
the
start
the
harps
were
hoping
for
but
there
were
certainly
some
very
encouraging
aspects
take
from
the
game
most
notably
the
performance
minor
hurler
shane
fitzpatrick

senior

pakie
flynn

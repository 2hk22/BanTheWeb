roger
federer
falls
category
greatest
players
lot
people
play
sports
and
gain
success
but
there
are
only
few
them
who
manage
feel
invincible
certain
stages
their
career
and
they
are
called
legends
needless
say
that
roger
federer
falls
that
same
category
when
comes
lawn
tennis
there
has
hardly
been
anyone
the
game
who
has
been
dominant
federer
over
many
years
and
going
fairly
strong
even
today
the
swiss
federer
has
had
quite
few
seasons
his
career
when
has
smashed
almost
every
opponent
that
has
come
his
way
but
out
all
was
the
most
successful
according
federer
had
such
great
hold
over
his
game
that
season
that
never
felt
someone
was
going
beat
him
any
point
federer
ended
with
title
winning
record
which
was
absolutely
incredible
had
taken
part
tournaments
and
had
walked
out
champion
them
speaking
his
latest
interview
website
federer
who
still
top
players
the
world
said
was
quite
special
was
confident
right
through
that
year
was
sort
impossible
for
end
the
losing
side
there
was
invincible
feeing
was
great
situation

quite

would
get
female
coach
marinko
matosevic
still
quite
firm
his
stand
that
would
never
even
think
about
being
coached
female
matosevic
had
said
the
same
thing
while
back
too
when
the
scot
player
andy
murray
had
named
amelie
mauresmo
his
coach
back
june
when
the
year
old
aussie
was
asked
the
female
coaches
could
prove
helpful
for
the
male
players
this
what
had
say
far
concerned
would
never
that
but
andy
obviously
thinks
differently
got
great
coaching
from
his
mother
the
initial
phases
his
career
now
should
wait
and
watch
how
shapes
under
amelie

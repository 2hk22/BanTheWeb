the
lolsingularity
near
here
first
there
were
the
lolcats
and
they
were
good
then
came
the
lolrus
and
the
loldogs
and
the
webtertrons
saw
them
and
they
were
good
also
soon
followed
the
lolgays
lolcode
the
lolbrarians
and
others
their
ilk
and
yea
even
lolbots
and
loltrek
propagate
their
lolmemes
within
single
rotation
the
earth
and
the
webtertrons
saw
that
the
pace
lolmeme
creation
and
spread
was
accelerating
exponentially
and
they
trembled
the
coming
lolsingularity
inevitable
event
that
will
shake
the
webtertrons
their
core
the
lolsingularity

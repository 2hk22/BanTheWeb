outs
should
considered
genuine
signal
that
real
change
has
finally
happened
the
first
eleven
has
started
have
certain

permanency
about
them
whilst
recent
squads
have
not
included
winnall
and
ramage
both
will
undoubtedly
return
and
have
colossal
part
play
terms
where
barnsley
will
finish
after
less
than
convincing
first
attempt
the
dawn
the
season
adam
davies
has
made
real
claim
for
the
number
one
jersey
recently
the
absence
turnbull
can
happy
that
waring
has
passion
for
the
shirt
and
remains
oakwell
until
the
end
the

with
the
heirarchy
also
looking
replicate
that
sort
agreement
too
for
manchester
united
loanee
ben
pearson
hourihane
showing
glimpses
recapturing
the
imperious
form
and
attitude
which
brought
him
much
praise
before
the

another

quality
that
worrying
more
maybe
the
point
trying
make
summed
best
greavsie
the

who
said

very
rarely

bad

have

where
his

fall
somewhat

normal
but
rarely
will
poor
young
players
the

are
wildly
inconsistent
they
can
fire
one

and
anonymous
the
next
whilst
not
inevitable
that
the
final
twelve
fixtures
will
contain
substantial
number
off
colour
performances
reasonable
expect
will
happen
when
preston
north
end

sheffield

oakwell
will
need
our
very

away
from
home
those
key
trips
bristol
city
oldham
and
bradford
city
can
expect
every
player
stand
and
counted
opportunities
the
deal
which
saw
leroy
lita
join
notts
county
loan
for
the
remainder
the
season
may
prove
one
lee
johnson
earliest
and
potentially
most
prudent
decision
whilst
lita
has
undoubtedly
proven
his
talents
the
likes
bristol
city
middlesbrough
and
swansea
city
his
stay
south
yorkshire
has
largely
been
disappointing
after
scoring
his
first
two
league
games
since
august
twenty
one
game
barren
spell
has
ensued
perhaps
one
consideration
may
have
been
that
senior
professional
his
calibre
who
may
not
have
been
enjoying
his
football
could
have
been
destabilising
influence
amongst
the
younger
crop
equally
with
sam
winnall
looking
like
may
have
recovered
from
his
own
injury
nightmare
and
george
waring
being
the
preferred
partner
top
lita
could
see
the
writing
the
wall
with
bit
financial
freedom
that
the
lita
deal
creates
johnson
might
have
bit
room
shake
the

the

been
more

that
swept

asked
him
step
his

always
said
that
went
into

would
take
him
with
sheridan
told
the
club
website
tommy
has
terrific
record
bringing
young
players
through
this
club
and
like
myself
very
excited
about
the
future
and
when
sheridan
joined
chesterfield
june
was
his
trusty

turned
once
more
support
him
mounting

challenge
success
they
achieved
together
champions

wright
had
brief
spell
caretaker
boss
the
spireites
before
leaving
april
and
returning
oldham
assistant
manager
nearly
five
years
after
leaving
the
league
one
club
knew
lee
johnson
played
under
chesterfield
loan
there
saw
him
reserve
game
and
had
chat
few
days
ago
asked
would
interested
was
desperate
get
back
the
coaching
side
didn
have
any
second
thoughts
what
makes
him
tick
naturally
time
will
tell
however
found
audio
file
soundcloud
from
just
under
two
years
ago
this
interview
with
the
chesterfield
post
wright
comes
across
being
refreshingly
honest
and
very
likeable
character
there
certainly
hint
hillcroft
guardiola
complex
ego
work
here
certainly
recommended
listening
for
all
those
oakwell

out
there
final
note
could
tommy
wright
have
inadvertently
been
singing
the
praises
lee
johnson
return
when
made
the
following
remarks
think
over
the
last
four
five
years
really
studied
worked
extremely
hard
obviously
you
have
get
your
coaching
badges
but
other
ways
such
watching
dvds
and
reading
books
the
best
coaches
now
are
probably
the
best
educated
coaches
not
necessarily
the
best
players
their
careers
but
they
are
the
best

reasons
why
lee

the
perfect
choice
for
barnsley
the
cat
finally
out
the
bag
following
thirteen
days
since
the
departure
danny
wilson
which
included
seemingly
endless
hours
debate
speculation
and
rumours
barnsley

club
have
identified

new
head

onthepontyend
extend
huge
welcome
lee

and
wish
him
every
success
his
role
the
reds
the
immediate
future
and
beyond
whilst
every
appointment
likely
stir
range
emotions
opinions
amongst
supporters
convinced
that
brighter
future
awaits
under
the
stewardship
johnson
the
former
oldham
athletic
manager
has
developed
enviable
reputation
one
the
games
brightest
young
bosses
just
under
two
years
the
other
side
the
big
hill
has
been
tested
often
his
successes
have
shone
through
managerial
record
games
charge
boundary
park
johnson
has
won
drawn
and
lost
proving
win
percentage
his
first
game
charge
was
victory
against
hartlepool
united
march
which
lifted
oldham
out
the
relegation
zone
before
eventually
guiding
them

recruitment
following
his
short
introduction
the

eighteen

when

has
also
gone
the
demolition
the
old
broadway
stand
make
way
for
their
new
north
stand
operating
this
environment
johnson
has
proven
shrewd
operator
often
emulating
some
the
better
qualities
keith
hill
had
fixing
broken
toys
and
getting
bargain
there
are
many
examples
but
most
reds
fans
cannot
fail
have
seen

after
the
whole
sorry
ched
evans
saga
oldham
athletic
few
people
who
could
have
exited
this
drama
with
any
credit
lee
johnson
was
one
individual
who
did
against
back
drop
threats
against
staff
sponsors
threatening
pull
their
support
and
with
the
media
remained
camped
outside
boundary
park
politicians
also
took
stance
including
the
prime
minister
deputy
prime
minister
and
opposition
leader
people
signed
online
petition
was
period
intense
scrutiny
more
than
that
experienced
some
highest
profile
premier
league
managers
johnson
calmly
and
respectfully
took
his
stride
reputation
one
the
few
gaffers
the
football
league
with
active
twitter
account
lee
johnson
will
have
get
used
the
banter
and
direct
feedback
will
get
from
the
barnsley

also
clear
from
this

some

perhaps
one
the
most
famous
tales
relates
his
interview
oldham
arranged
for
him
admiring
kenny

where
eager
johnson
arrived
armed
with
reports
the
club
last
three
matches
all
had
been
attended
unannounced
and
undercover
this
level
detail
had
obviously
inflated
his
credentials
with
the

signalled
the
death
knell
the
hopes
other

johnson

with

loss
was
tough
season
for
fan
through
ever
had
and
say
that
having
gone
through
some
pretty
awful
seasons
thought
this
weekend
was
pretty
good
example
what
seen
all
year
from
the
seawolves
saw
some
guys
giving
their
all
and
some
guys
not
giving
their
all
saw
individual
players
try
too
much
themselves
saw
guys
take
selfish
and
dumb
penalties
there
was
persistence
and
character
displayed
our
guys
times
just
there
was
through
the
whole
season
saw
some
nice
skills
and
some
well
executed
plays
but
none
the
positives
were
anywhere
near
enough
have
any
consistent
success
there
more
than
few
reasons
for
this
awful
year
touched
some
them
here
but
serves
purpose
this
point
rehash
all
that
year
from
now
before
see
how
many
the
causes
can
rectified
case
you
didn
notice
gave
the
season
more
than
couple
weeks
ago
blame
high
expectations
coming
into
the
season
for
the
crash
fandom
have
comprehensive
recruit
update
forthwith
time
look
forward
next
year
and
start
with
all
the
guessing
and
speculation
and
hoping
all
the
best
the
seniors
their
hockey
and
non
hockey
futures
there
can
nothing
but
respect
toward
year
student
athletes
takes
loads
character
and
dedication
and
organization
make
that
happen
congratulations
those
guys
and
hope
they
always
fondly
look
back
the
last
years

pretty

big
minutes

they
already
been
out

this
period
northern
first
penalty
clear
result
the
work
done

maintaining
possession
and
pressure
deep
the
offensive
end
they
the
horses
right
three
northern
first
shots
came
within
seconds
after
minutes
had
passed
they
had
couple
good
scoring
chances
inside
the
slot
and
mantha
was
super
solid
handling
them
the
last
timeout
northern
had
started
asserting
themselves
and
now
outshooting
the
seawolves
play
has
been
going
both
ways
versus
the
more
positive
start
that
the
seawolves
had
scottie
allen
got
tied
along
the
half
wall
with
northern
player
the
play
broke
into
the
other
end
was
solid
seconds
before
allen
could
join
the
team
northern
zone
but
worked
the
puck
from
the
back
wall
out
front
and
got
hooked
the
way
good
effort
dude
broke
and
looked
off
feigning

instead
beat

cleanly
late
goals

seconds

the
period
not

was

there

the

the
seems
have
helped
the

have
turned
the

only
shots

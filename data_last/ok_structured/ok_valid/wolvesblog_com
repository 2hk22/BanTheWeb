might
just
more
dangerous
than
any
the
five
remaining
opponents
wolves
were
playing
different
level
leeds
for
hour
monday
but
then
allowed
the
game
wriggle
away
from
them
course
taking
your
foot
off
the
pedal
two
goals
and
coasting
isn
bad
situation
but
trait
that
could
ultimately
prove
costly
there
question
kenny
jackett
has
found
his
best
team
and
just
the
right
moment
too
but
they
need
more
ruthless
when
the
opposition
are
the
ropes
hopefully
that
starts
saturday
andrew
birmingham
there
was
time
thought
blues
might
climb
above
the
table
was
just
after
gary
rowett
took
over
november
and
wolves
were
sliding
fortunately
for
things
picked
the
new
year
while
birmingham
couldn
maintain
the
charge
still
for
club
that
continues
such
turmoil
off
the
field
midtable
isn
bad
place
they
could
yet
finish
the
top
half
their
home
form
has
also
improved
significantly
under
rowett
and
they
highly
motivated
put
dent
their
neighbours
late
season
surge
our
old
friend
paul
robinson
won
playing
though
was
sent
off
they
capitulated
against
bournemouth
monday
wolves
same
team
and
again
that
got
the
mantra
for
kenny
jackett
with
momentum
rapidly
building
doherty
van
parra
and
edwards
could
all
pushing
for
start
the
manager
wants
change
things
around
but
can
see
happening
interesting
that
michael
jacobs
was
recalled
today
remains
player
never
disappointed
see
around
the
team
might
yet
needed
the
gaffer
predictions
team
will
want
face
our
front
three
and
can
see
blues
being
any
different
fact
haven
felt
more
confident
going
into
any
derby
for
long
time
wolves
play
well
think
they
win
this
game
and
hopefully
with
degree
comfort
blues
will
raise
their
level
and
have
some
difficult
players
donaldson
particular
someone
always
rated
but
overall
got
away
win
four
points
from
the
next
two
would
good
return

six

had
finally
sprung
like
this

had
genuinely
started
and
with
the
warm
sunshine
signalling
end
obdurate
winter
molineux
assumed
hazy
proportions
like
flashback
when
really
were
full
bloom
gold
shirts
the
south
bank
continuous
the
stars
that
shine
and
all
that
this
game
should
have
been
over
our
potent
attacking
threat
finally
broke
leeds
united
resolve
when
nouha
dicko
scored
the
stroke
half
time
and
benik
afobe
forced
home
just
minutes
into
the
second
period
that
really
should
have
been
that
but
like
boozy
bank

self

sloppiness
undermined
our
best

following
kevin

infuriating
gaffe
for
the
first
goal
danny
batth
made
rick
for
leeds
second
before
richard
stearman
followed
suit
for
the
third
surrendering
possession
carelessly
full
credit
the
excellent
alex
mowatt
his
finish
was
befitting
stellar
weekend
strikes
and
served
wolves
right
for
assuming
such
complacent
approach
woozy
second
half
when
the
south
bank
was
bellowing
never
ending
new
anthem
homage
dicko
afobe
and
sako
they
were
either
giving
the
ball
away
with
their
teammates
showboating
excessively
like
the
points
were
the
bag
with
two
minutes
left
agitated
kenny
jackett
stood
pensive
mood
until
edwards
flashed
upon
our
eyes
and
molineux
went
absolutely
bonkers
like
the
good
old
days
and
with
five

left
our
pleasure
fills
dancing

the

things
can
turn
sour
very
quickly
this
unforgiving

one
narrow
defeat
injury
key
player
often
enough
see
everything
fall
apart
this
looks
like
one
the
more
winnable
remaining
fixtures
but
every
team
provide
different
challenge
leeds
will
different
leeds
united
prior
the
weekend
leeds
were
enjoying
purple
patch
otherwise
mediocre
season
they
won
three
their
last
five
matches
and
looked
decent
bet
for
top
half
finish
then
out
nowhere
their
assistant
manager
was
suspended
neil
redfearn
was
considering
his
position
and
blackburn
thumped
them
turmoil
with
such
continual
off
the
field
drama
can
they
ever
expect
progress
beyond
the
second
tier
suppose
watford
are
showing
success
amongst

leeds
are
low

don
concede

captain
rudy

misses
this

through
suspension
after
being
sent
off
against
blackburn
saturday
wolves
when
kenny
jackett
discovered
winning
formula
last
season
more
less
stuck
with
the
same
team
therefore
not
expecting
many
changes
tomorrow
doherty
could
return
however
the
emphasis
attack
rather
than
defence
dominic
iorfa
was
shrewdly
brought
specifically
combat
the
threat
antonio
forest
which
did
admirably
edwards
and
van
parra
are
the
obvious
alternatives
kenny
wants
shift
things
around
but
with
just
six
games
should
really
the
best
team
every
time
predictions
this
open
game
can
only
see
home
win
due
obvious
disparity
firepower
but
that
unlikely
the
case
expect
leeds
adopt
the
reading
and
charlton
model
which
was
successful
for
both
those
sides
molineux
but
even
they
can
remain
compact
and
well
organised

occupying

inside

there
wasn
much
doing
but
smart
turn

and
drop
the
shoulder
later
was
stroking
the
ball
into
the
corner
for
the
game
pivotal
moment
the
best
goal
scored
this
season
tough
sure
now
got
choose
from
nine
those
have
come
for
wolves
and
what
variety
finishes
already
witnessed
volleys
headers
tap
ins
one
ones
and
now
surging
run
from
deep
capped
with
unerringly
calm
finale
kenny
jackett
has
consistently
stated
only
wants
bring
players
that
will
improve
the
team
and
boy
has
benik
afobe
fulfilled
that
criteria
even
bakary
sako
playing
second
fiddle
the
former
arsenal
man
but
with
the
opposition
jugular
exposed
was
soon
moving
for
the
kill
the
penalty
was
indisputable
and
just
one
several
dangerous
tackles
sako
was
peppered
with
forest
struggled
contain
him
the
break
fitting
too
that
should
slot
home
the
winning
goal
against
the
club
who
little
over
year
ago
must
have
seemed
more
appetising
alternative
that
loyalty
whether
voluntary
otherwise
could
yet
prove
the
luckiest
escape

career
certainly
the
manager
getting
the
best
out
the
mali

with
the
rest
the

carl

was
back
swell
the
numbers
today
and
the
decision
immediately
reinstate
our
number
one
was
justified
his
performance
other
than
one
nervy
moment
when
clearance
was
nearly
charged
down
his
handling
and
kicking
were
close
impeccable
the
defence
kept
him
well
protected
standing
strong
early
forest
pressure
and
remaining
compact
throughout
when
ikeme
was
exposed
three
occasions
the
second
half
antonio
and
paterson
fluffed
their
lines
before
blackstock

andrew

the
hammering

gave

that
horrendous
five

losing
run
november
wolves
just
didn
come
out
for
the
second
half
that
match
and
forest
deservedly
put
the
sword
notts
forest
that
was
false
dawn
for
stuart
pearce
though
after
beating
they
skidded
down
the

and

well

but
the
scot
has
been
revelation
was
only
really
the
defeat
norwich
last
time
out
that
took
the

out

and
repeat

trick
brentford
monday
they
still
with

all
nothing
for
them
now
which
daunting
thought
for
kenny
jackett
wolves
what
difference
striker
makes
derby
coasted
against
clarke
november
but
capitulated
against
the
dicko
afobe
connection
remember
the
forest
game
molineux
well
and
with
pace
get
behind
their
defence
they
simply
pushed
the
field
and
dominated
like
derby
they
won
have
that
luxury
this
time
the
only
question
does
kenny
jackett
persevere
with
both
strikers
sacrifice
one
try
and
get
hold
the
ball
suspect
carry
with
both
dicko
and
afobe
and
that
probably
the
right
tactic
the
very
least
want
down
swinging
the
other
end
would
put
carl
ikeme
straight
back
between
the
sticks
but
suspect
kuszczak
will
retain
the
shirt
for

one
more

earlier

this

doesn
benefit
anyone
greatly
can
see

the

has
been
used
with
great
results
some
the

possible
since
the

system
involves
complex
computer
system
that
visually

other
scientific

the

can

determine

the

what
makes
this

great
that
does

best
eliminate
human

even
the
nfl
system
replay
involves

interrupting
the

and
then
visually
looking
see
what
the

not
all

would
agree
how
the

these
situations
tennis
uses
math

get
the
calls
right
this
helps
eliminate
any

that
could

helps
eliminate

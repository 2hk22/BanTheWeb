belt
advancement
very
encouraging
see
the
positive
impact
has
had
our
youth
unfortunately
our
society
has
suffered
from
numerous
tragedies
where
children
have
been
the
victims
senseless
acts
violence
some
cases
the
hands
their
peers
research
has
shown
that
children
lacking
self
esteem
not
have
self
respect
consequently
this
results
lack
respect
for
others
martial
arts
programs
not
only
discourage
violence
rather
they
build
and
stimulate
self
esteem
within
the
child
are
attain
gentler
more
caring
society
must
teach
our
children
how
care
for

one
another

education
first
let
explain
that
use
the
phrase
pocket
pet
caring
way
when
say
pocket
pets
are
not
implying
that
they
are
toys
disposable
unworthy
pets
hamsters
rats
mice
guinea
pigs
rabbits
and
chinchillas
are
not
play
things
they
are
living

the
phrase
pocket
pets
used
now
our
name
instead
rabbit
small

because
too
many
people
think
the
phrase
small
animal
means
any
animal
other
than
farm
animals
horses
adopters
were
confused
and
were
calling
emailing
find
dogs
cats

has
helped
change
the
perception
the
types
companion

good
homes

far
and
few
between
only
when
rabbit
small

adopted
into

home
can
another
rescued
and
brought
into
one
the
foster
homes
rescuers
get
far
more
requests
asking
take
unwanted
pets
than
requests
from
people
seeking

because
this

was
not
classic
race
but
was
great
see
the
finest
sports
and
prototype
cars
the
world
this
classic
circuit
expected
peugeot
dominated
with
their
cars
finishing
first
and
second
but
the
lola
aston
stayed
closer
than
most
expected
and
the
drayson
racing
lola
judd
ran
well
for
several
hours
before
faltering
bit
the
end
the
highcroft
acura
team
dominated
the
class
for
most
the
race
but
late
mechanical
issues
left
them
second
and
gave
the
class
win
the
cytosport
porsche
spyder
the
class
battle
was
close
expected
with
the
win
going
the
risi
ferrari
this
win
coming
despite
tracy
krohn
the
second
risi
car
running
the
winning
car
off
the
road
the
middle
the
afternoon
seen
tracy
krohn
stuff
like
this
too
many
times
really
needs
racing
school
team

uncharacteristic
problems
both
mechanical
and
mental
emmanuel
collard
somehow
managed
not
notice
that
the
car
was
the
pit
already
and
just
drove
right
into
the
side
the
car
severely
damaging
both
cars
feel
certain
will
replaced
mans
the
new
lmp
challenge
class
the
level
team
bouchut
tucker
and
wilkins
dominated
winning
the
class
over
laps
these
new
cars
held
fairly
well
this
the
toughest
track
and
longest
race
the
schedule
and
they
should
more
competitive
with
the
other
prototypes
the
street
circuits
coming

terrific

brewing
hop
spider
build
feb
tried
various
methods
adding
hops
boil
kettle
during
the
course
the
last
several
years
when
first
started
brewing
was
brewing
extract
beers
with
this
process
used
lots
hop
pellets
with
the
pellets
came
the
hop
bag
some
the
beers
required
two
three
separate
hops
bags
depending
the
style
and
additions
soon
after
switching
all
grain
brewing
faced
new
challenge
really
enjoy
using
leaf
hops
for
brewing
also
enjoy
letting
them
float
the
boil
unrestricted
the
problem
comes
when
time
transfer
the
cooled
wort
into
the
fermentor
don
want
the
hop
debris
making
there
way
into
the
fermentor
found
several
solutions
work
around
this
issue
but
was
still
faced
with
lots
loose
hops
clean
out
boil
kettle
the
end
the
brew
day
finally
found
the
answer
after
reading
one
favorite
home
brew
magazines
called
the
hop
spider
for
whatever
reason
you
have
decided
try
the
hop
spider
you
will
find
this
build
very
simple
and
inexpensive
the
hop
spider
allows
you
make
whatever
additions
you
want
make
whatever
time
you
want
make
them
you
can
all
this
using
only
one
strainer
bag
this
very
simple
process
once
the
boil
over
and
its
time
remove
the
hops
you
simply
remove
the
hop
spider
and
attached
strainer
bag
this
incredibly
easy
use
parts
list
one
inch
inch
pvc
reducing
coupling
one
nylon
paint
staining
bag
other
hop
bag
three
all
thread
with
each
nuts
and
each
wing
nuts
one
stainless
steel
hose
clamp
that
will
fit
the
inch
end
the
coupling
power
drill
with
drill
bit
start
drilling
three
evenly
spaced
holes
into
the
top
side
the
reducer
coupling
thread
one
the
nuts
approximately
onto
the
all
thread
repeat
this
for
all
three
threads
place
the
all
thread
into
the
coupling
shown
thread
nut
onto
the
all
thread
the
inside
the
coupling
hold
the
all
thread
securely
place
complete
this
process
for
all
three
threads
you
should
now
have
something
that
looks
like
the
picture
above
gently
place
the
strainer
bag
over
the
outer
edges
the
coupling
once
place
secure
the
strainer
using
the
stainless
steel
hose
clamp
the
wing
nuts
are
used
keep
the
hop
spider
place
simply
thread
the
wing
nuts
onto
the
all
thread
until
they
line
with
the
edge
your
kettle
you
should
now
have
completed

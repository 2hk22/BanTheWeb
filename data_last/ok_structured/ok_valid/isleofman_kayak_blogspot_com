surviving
gibraltar
this
blog
has
been
devoid
entries
and
photographs
late
part
the
reason
that
fried
another
waterproof
camera
that
fourth
three
years
far
destroyed
three
pentax
and
one
olympus
marine
cameras
normally
straight
out
and
replace
but
not
this
time
struggling
decide
which
one
buy
come
the
conclusion
that
called
waterproof
cameras
best
last
about
one
year
should
buy
cheap
camera
with
poor
picture
quality
shell
out
top
spec
lumix
still
can
decide
and
until
photographs
this
blog
may
continue
snapped
blackberry

like
the
ones
above
you
can
see
was
gibraltar
working
for
christmas
should
you
find
yourself
similar
situation
confined
the
rock
which
only
couple
miles
square
then
here
are
some
truisms
careful
who
you
accuse
being
spanish
and
never
ask
why
gibraltar
british
not
put
food
down
anywhere
unless
hermetically
sealed
container
the
place
infested
ants
similarly
never
eat
food
the
dark
although
believe
from
certain
survival
programs
that
ants
are
quite
nutritious
electrical
goods
are
sold
duty
free
gibraltar
but
somehow
this
makes
them
more
expensive
than
home
where
have
duty
you
are
never
far
from
cannon
gibraltar
the
best
locum
consultant
anaesthetist
job
the
world
found
here
but
alas
all
comes
end
march
the
apes
especially
the
small
ones
look
cute
but
fact
they
are
vicious
you
are
scared

sea
kayaking
isle
man
weight
paddling
tidal
rapids
becoming
sport
its
own
right
been
researching
tidal
race
kayaking
for
new
section
kayak
describing
well
paddled
tidal
races
from
around
the
world
looked
little
boat
design
and
its
reassuring
find
that
boat
manufacturers
are
producing
sea
kayaks
designed
specifically
for
this
relatively
new
sport
one
well
known
british
manufacturer
not
rockpool
produces
boat
which
heavily
rockered
with
flat
midsection
the
hull
gives
great
manoeuvrability
big
water
whilst
well
defined
chines
and
buoyant
ends
provide
solid
stability
and
control
the
wave
well
you
can
argue
with
that
and
think
that
how
want
next
sea
kayaking
play
boat
one
slightly
less
well
known
north
american
manufacturer
also
producing
what
describes
british
style
boat
with
skeg
with
many
the
attributes
the
first
boat
mentioned
one
important
difference
between
the
two
stood
out
though
the
british
company
producing
boat
which
weighs
the
north
american
boat
weighs
just
put
this
the
company
thought
that
the
weight
mentioned
their
web
site
must
mistake
just
seems
way
too
heavy
and
they
replied
the
boat
features
heavier
duty
layup
than
found
our
other
boats
the
core
material
approx
thicker
could
course
have
chosen
produce
lightweight
boat
but
the
danger
with
this
that
will
not
have
suitable
stiffness
and
failure
mode
upon
impact
will
critical
our
preference
make
the
boat
extremely
rigid
prevent
flex
big
conditions
with
toughness
that
will
give
the
boat
longevity
that
light
weight
will
not
don
think
can
argue
with
that
certainly
rockpool
alaw
bach
does
flex
bit
the
extreme
conditions
sometimes
encountered
our
isle
man
tidal
races
the
other
hand
one
the
rockpools
use
piece
and
has
held
together
very
well
could
this
dichotomy
opinion
reflect
the
differences
our
tidal
races
north
america
especially
around
vancouver
island
tidal
flows
regularly
reach
double
digits
and
need
weather
whip
them
the
races
which
the
british
boat
used
are
slower
flowing
but
when
whipped
the
frequent
gales
become
gnarly
less
predictable
and
hostile
perhaps
requiring
firmer
layup
the
end
the
day
guess
boils
down
personal
preference
happy
with
rockpool
but
were
consider
purchasing
new
boat
then
think
trip
washington
state
may
order
the
new
tidal
race
section
still
under
construction
but
the
meantime
you
can
read
about
the
surge
rapids
and
the
okisollo
waves

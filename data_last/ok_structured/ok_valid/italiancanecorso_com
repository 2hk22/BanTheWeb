todd
have
worked

for
more
than
twenty
years
and
have
had
the
pleasure
observing
some
the
most
remarkable
examples
police
canines
the
history
the
profession
recently
witnessed
canine
trials
which
cane
corso
was
put
through
the
paces
and
the
test
must
confess
rarely
have
witnessed
such
courage
character
strength
intelligence
obedience
and
agility
any
dog
that
which
saw
the
cane
corso
the
withers
and
lbs
was
nothing
less
than
poetry
motion
certainly
made
believer
out
that
day
until
then
the
rottweiler
was
favorite
breed
dog
and
the
only
breed
which
would
place
unqualified
trust
but
now
that
has
changed
the
cane
corso
now
shares
that
distinction

todd
wanted
tell
you
how
much
appreciate
all
the
time
you
have
obviously
put
into
such
wonderful
website
your
dogs
are
remarkable
and
beautiful
apparently
other
breeders
have
noticed
and
covet
your
high
standards
was
appalled
learn
that
another
breeder
had
been
found
using
pictures
their
ads
cane
corsos
you
had
produced
without
your
permission
sell
their
litters
that
deceptive
but
also
shows
where
your
dogs
stand
among
the
others
one
many
who
admire
your

and
did
indeed
use
their

without
notice
the
reader
that
wasn
their
product
and
that
they
didn

unethical
dishonest
attempt
mislead

kind
altercation
their

couple
years

the

were
called

threatened

with

the

requested
that

unharmed
refused
holding

effectively
hiding

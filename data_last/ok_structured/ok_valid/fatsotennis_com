back
vic
braden
week
and
forehand
april
author
tom
antion
when
was
vic
braden
tennis
college
vic
said
that
forehand
was
not
extending
out
the
target
enough
said
with
brain
makeup
that
was
common
error
also
said
that
watching
tennis
and
video
contributes
the
error
hmmmmm
how
thought
vic
has
done
enormous
amount
high
speed
videotaping
filming
sometimes
frames
per
second
which
allows
super
slow
motion
playback
strokes
with
normal
video
things
happen
fast
the
human
eye
and
brain
cannot
see
what
really
happened
during
the
stroke
the
brain
skips
things
and
just
sees
the
beginning
and
end
stroke
and
not
what
happens
between
with
the
circular
followthroughs
over
the
shoulder
around
the
waist
the
forehand
looks
like
the
stroke
goes
from
backswing
contact
over
the
shoulder
directly
things
happen
fast
our
eyes
and
brain
don
see
the
pronounced
extension
toward
the
target
that
the
best
pros
use
just
see
backswing
and
windshield
wiper
and
most
club
players
try
emulate
that
usually
with
poor
results
why
are
the
results
poor
the
reason
the
results
are
poor
that
going
from
the
backswing
the
windshield
wiper
directly
gives
only
few
inches
margin
hit
the
ball
cleanly
you
have
excellent
timing
then
you
can
hit
fairly
consistently
when
balls
come
you
consistently
the
trouble
comes
with
slow
balls
fast
balls
that
throw
off
your
timing
with
only
few
inches
perfect
the
strike
zone
this
causes
shanks
and
hits
that
fly
all
over
the
place
vic
videotaped
roger
federer
and
juan
martin
del
potro
and
found
that
when
you
really
watch
slow
motion
roger
strike
zone
for
clean
hit
just
going
from
memory
here
feet
and
del
potro
even
longer
both
have
world
class
forehands
their
swing
speed
fast
all
normally
see
the
backswing
and
the
over
the
shoulder
follow
through
and
never
notice
this
extremely
pronounced
strike
zone
wonder
they
are
great
when
they
have
feet
hit
the
ball
cleanly
and
most
only
have
few
inches
what
vic
did
with
since
was
raining
little
took
the
gymnasium
and
andy
one
his
top
coaches
fed
forehands
was
supposed
hit
them
the
other
end
the
gym
right
into
the
center
the
padded
wall
behind
the
basketball
hoop
wasn
even
supposed
follow
through
all
was
supposed
catch
racket
way
out
front
toward
the
target
was
also
supposed
hit
the
ball
way
out
front
with
totally
cocked
back
wrist
throughout
the
stroke
when
quit
raining
went
back
the
courts
and
got
the
ball
machine
out
was
supposed
take
what
learned
the
gym
pick
targets
and
hit
forehands
did
not
shank
one
forehand
and
most
them
had
depth
and
accuracy
since
this
new
during
practice
consciously
thinking
about
extending
toward
the
target
more
each
forehand
and
sure
keep
this
over
time
this
will
become
natural
and
fast
when
you
see
video
you
see
the
backswing
and
the
windshield
wiper
but
you
know
snuck
pronounced
extension
toward
the

wow
did
get
tennis
thrill
yesterday
was
new
york
speaking
and
speaker
friend
mine
jane
ubell
who
just
happens
married
former
top
player
rick
meyer
arranged
tennis
lesson
for
rick
has
beaten
some
the
all
time
greats
like
ilie
nastase
and
others
that
put
this
post
soon
get
their
names
here
rick
meyer
and
his
lovely
wife
jane
ubell
just
after
rick
gave
tennis
lesson
the
city
view
tennis
club
new
york
city
here
what
rick
told
after
working
with
for
hour
likes
forehand
but
emphasized
never
missing
told
have
consistent
game
hit
the
ball
from
just
about
every
time
get
good
net
clearance
and
depth
likes
topspin
backhand
but
again
wanted
never
miss
the
end
the
lesson
did
not
miss
one
top
spin
backhand
again
mentioned
hitting
low
high
with
plenty
net
clearance
said
you
can
win
consistently
smashing
the
ball
flat
did
not
like
slice
back
hand
all
said
leading
with
elbow
and
popping
the
ball
and
putting
mostly
side
spin
the
ball
said
was
pretty
much
hitting
the
ball
flat
and
wanted
pronounced
underspin
there
were
various
other
things
didn
like
about
that
can
remember
what
remember
that
said
must
lead
with
the
racket
head
not
elbow
said
its
very
slow
stroke
and
even
though
upper
arm
moving
slowly
the
racket
head
will
moving
much
faster
since
the
end
the
lever
said
picture
table
top
front
turn
very
much
the
side
and
hit
down
the
table
top
did
not
like
overhead
shanked
quite
few
said
was
because
was
focusing
the
outcome
not
the
process
said
when
gets
overhead
his
mind
saying
thank
you
the
opponent
because
the
point
over
said
does
not
care
where
the
opponent
and
has
absolutely
zero
focus
the
other
side
the
net
all
focuses
the
ball
contact
showed
that
even
switches
what
looked
like
year
old
pancake
grip
make
sure
hit
the
ball
perfectly
the
center
the
racket
said
can
hit
hundreds
row
without
missing
because
focuses
the
process
not
the
outcome
didn
really
like
volley
said
more
like
high
five
motion
and
the
time
was
done
with
was
cranking
some
pretty
fast
pace
that
was
able
handle
because
the
high
five
motion
simply
get
right
front
the
ball
with
the
racket
also
emphasized
keeping
everything
out
front
with
the
racket
head
did
not
like
serve
all
this
was
little
perplexing
because
had
just
come
from
vic
braden
training
where
was
doing
darn
good
and
added
ton
speed
but
hadn
had
any
practice
with
new
method
learned
vic
since
getting
home
looked
pretty
pitiful
mostly
what
didn
like
was
ball
toss
filled
glass
water
and
made
through
the
tossing
motion
with
full
glass
water
luckily
were
clay
where
little
spillage
doesn
hurt
ran
out
time
but
before
did
cranked
some
pretty
good
serves
but
obviously
have
lot
practice
front
with
new
found
speed
and
two
methods
wrestle
with
pretty
cool
though
when
you
standing
next
guy
like
rick
who
can
effortlessly
crank
hundred
mph
serve
pretty
much
nonchalantly
while
talking
overall
this
was
thrill
lifetime
get
lesson
from
someone
who
has
been
there
and
done
that
the
way
rick
promised
give
blog
posting
with

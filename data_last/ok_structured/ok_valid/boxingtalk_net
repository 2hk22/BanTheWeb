the

also
just
wanted
your

floyd

possibly
being

think
floyd
has
ths
because
too
defensive
pac
will

you
believe
the

hype
that
will

aggressive
mayweather
bread
response
would
love
see
floyd
try
walk
manny
down
that
would
make
for
epic
evening
from

floyd
spars
more
aggressively
than
actually
fights
maybe
feels
though
the
judges
have
not
been
his
side
lately
and
has
more
aggressive
let
see
don
want
speculate
because
think
floyd
spars
with
more
high
activity
than
fights
because
that
gets
him

that
doesn

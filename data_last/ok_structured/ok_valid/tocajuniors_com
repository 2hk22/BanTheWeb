who

little
about
our
origins
experience
and
project
established
the
club
came
life
simple
indoor
team
organized
few
mates
who
shared
the
passion
for
football
and
competition
the
time
most
the
founding
members
were
involved
other
competitive
teams
but
felt
that
there
was
something
missing
the
search
for
more
than
passes
and
goals
the
club
quickly
built
reputation
for
its
comraderie
the
seasons
progressed
and
the
interest
grew
moved
into
aside
leagues
where
quickly
conquered
their
first
championship
are
still
awaiting
for
the
trophy
thou
the
team
originated
from
heavily
hispanic
group
thus
the
hispanic
name
has
since
evolved
into
club
where
anyone
with
passion
for
football
costls
home
currently
the
club
represented
more
than
dozen
nationalities
our

called
provides
opportunities
for
adults
compete
and
engage
the
game
and
the

many
parents
youth
players
and
club
directors
actively
participate
these
teams
likewise
most
our

they
will
have
the
opportuntity
absorb
the
passion
for
the
game
well
learning
the
technical
aspects
adult

our
experience
with

teams
the
initiative
create
the

driven
the
great
experience
had
with
our
first

team
guided
core

players
for
years
until
the
boys
now
turned
men
departed
for
university
this
superb
trip
numerous
championships
and
sportmanship
awards
left
with
plenty
ideas
how
repeat
the
experience
personal
level
where
shared

college
application
processes
bbqs
and
much
more
well
how
improve
the
training
and
athletic
development
provide
invite
you
read
through
our

what
seek
the
resulting

plan
has
been
develop
proper

structure
thus
have
integrated
our
youth
teams
our
adult

the
initiative
well
its
way
can
seen
our
website
were
you
can
get
costl
where
are
headed
and
the
general
atmosphere
provide
the
core
concept
and
essence
train
two
teams
together
believe
that
this
will
give
more
liberty
and
alternatives
terms
conducting
drills
scrimmages
and
competitive
games
during
practices
think
that
pooling
our
efforts
and
creating
single
atmosphere
kids
will
bond
more
they
will
costl
part
something
more
significant
with
more
presence
coaching
philosophy
further
explain
the
goal
pooling
our
coaching
efforts
find
that
aspect
that
can
greatly
enhance
the
development
child
the
variation
drills
and
exercises
repetitiveness
can
create
stale
atmosphere
and
can
also
lead
overdeveloping
certain
aspects
player
while
leaving
others
unattended
find
that
when
coach
together
the
presence
various
licensed
coaches
leads
more
variation
and
fresher
more
enthusiastic
practice
furthermore
one
coach
leads
the
effort
organizing
and
setting
the
tone
the
practice
the
other
coaches
can
approach
players
individually
offer
one
one
support
making
the
atmosphere
more
relaxed
and
friendly
often
the
problem
with
one
coach
approach
that
the
coach
too
busy
giving
explanations
and
commands
instead
relaxing
and
getting
know
the
players
lastly
having
multiple
coaches
allows
avoid
the
involvement
parents
the
practice
itself
find
that
helpful
they
are
licensed
coach
who
has
extensive
experience
coaching
and
playing
much
better
alternative

many
players
from

group
will
attending

allowing
them
continue
their

they
have
also
expressed
their

helping

with
our

divisions
this
invaluable
resource
they
know
the
atmosphere
and

the
club
making
them
the
perfect

transmit
our
soccer
culture
our
newcomers
kids
are
normally
consciously
unconsciously
looking
for
role
models
superstars
and
professional
athletes
can
excellent
examples
but
practical
terms
child
cannot
implement
aspects
these
figures
into
their
day
day
activities
and
personal
lives
coach
great
role
model
well
but
sometimes
due
age
difference
they
can
seem
bit
distant
kids
often
relate
and
are
more
open
suggestions
from
young
adults
they
see
them
older
brothers
and
not

under
our
club
structure
the
kids
have
easy
time

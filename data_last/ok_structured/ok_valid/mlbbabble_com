the

are
about
the

out

they
live
stats
records
are
sacred
and
pitchers
losing
teams
with
losing
records
are
usually
overlooked
young
voters
felix
hernandez
was
awarded
the
american
league
young
thursday
boasting
overall
record
wins
and
losses
and
while
the
odds
such
record
winning
the
award
are
really
astronomical
the
decision
makes
perfect
sense
once
you
weigh
out
the
rest
king
felix
statistics
games
roughly
innings
pitches
felix
had
blistering
low
era
giving
earned
runs
and
recording
strikeouts
his
best
all
around
season
far
and
the
best
season
the
this
year
the
fact
that
only
won
games
extremely
misleading
sure
boston
dynamic
duo
jon
lester
and
clay
buchholz
were
certainly
strong
pitchers
this
year
but
there
weren
felix
level
the
yankees
sabathia
also
gave
great
performance
well
tampa
david
price
and
both
the
rays
and
new
york
made
the
playoffs
but
when
was
all
said
and
done
hernandez
was
simply
better
than
the
competition
team
with
even
the
slightest
bit
run
support
felix
would
have
not
only
eclipsed
the
win
mark
but
might
looking
pennant
winner
that
how
great
was
this
year
going
will
always
make
some
cringe
look
that
lone
statistic
but
important
understand
that
hernandez
was
out
there
losing
games
etc
and
didn
really
have
single
game
that
you
could
call
bad
baseball
standards
the
odds
felix
repeating
this
type
performance
next
year
are
actually
pretty
good
still
very
young
man
only
and
signed
with
the
seattle
mariners
through
meaning
they
have
their

locked
time

some
much
needed
run

you
wouldn
find
odds
this
good
you
were

local
office
football
pool
felix
has
what
voters
are
looking
for
and
that
was
evident
when
earned
possible
first
place
votes
seattle
will
probably
fail
make
the
playoffs
again
next

and
may
fact
play

joe
blanton
gets
million
year
reply
joe
blanton
signed
three
year
million
contract
yesterday
avoid
arbitration
and
stay
with
the
phillies
now
locked
into
rotation
featuring
roy
halladay
cole
hamels
and
happ
when
first
saw
the
headlines
thought
this
deal
was
ridiculous
how
could
blanton
worth
million
year
the
guy
three
four
starter
with
average
stuff
but
then
looked
his
numbers
well
looked
where
the
phillies
were
coming
from
blanton
only
years
old
and
has
posted
least
innings
the
last
two
seasons
his
era
decreased
from
posted
career
bests
last
season
and
and
with
oakland
put
innings
with
era
proof
that
can
penciled
for
quite
few
innings
bearing
all
that
mind
makes
sense
that
the
phillies
made
this
move
coupled
with
signing
shane
victorino
they
just
traded
for
and
signed
halladay
they
have
hamels
for
while
and
they
have
happ
for
while
thus
makes
perfect
sense
for
the

put
together
rotation
like

babe
ruth
played
professional
baseball
from
hitting
then
record
home
runs
the
game
was
much
different
back
then
the
game
has
since
evolved
whereas
ruth
was
the
only
player
his
generation
approaching
the
home
run
plateau
that
mark
longer
considered
almost
unattainable
accomplishment
four
players
have
hit
more
home
runs
besides
ruth
roger
maris
mark
mcgwire
and
sammy
sosa
and
and
barry
bonds
all
the
above
aside
from
maris
have
been
connected
with
performance
enhancing
drugs
one
form
another
most
notably
recent
admission
but
stated
the
game
has
evolved
the
modern
game
pitcher
cannot
reach
miles
per
hour
will
most
likely
not
make
the
big
leagues
does
not
have
devastating
off
speed
pitch
breaking
ball
complement
his
fastball
will
not
make
the
big
leagues
pitchers
are
pure
and
simple
better
than
they
were
ruth
era
moreover
the
game
has
become
specialized
bullpens
are
utilized
more
often
now
than
ever
the
idea
five
pitchers
being
used
one
team
single
game
not
foreign
pitchers
become
better
over
time
hitters
need
well
the
neyer
james
guide
baseball
rob
neyer
and
bill
james
write
while
some
pitchers
could
make
ball
hop
and
some
people
could
make
ball
sink
there
evidence
any
major
league
pitcher
before
doing
both
switching
between
one
and
the
other
satchel
paige
threw
two
distinct
fastballs
the
when
pitched
the
negro
leagues
but
neither
them
was
sinking
fastball
pitchers
universally
seemed
regard
the
movement
their
fastball
not
function
strategy
but
gift
from
the
heavens
fastball
had
natural
sink
they
would
say
fastball
had
pretty
good
hop
had
pretty
good
speed
but
fastball
was
straight
had
keep
away
from
the
middle
the
plate
although
certainly
some
very
few
pitchers
would
learn
how
make
their
fastball
hop
how
make
their
fastball
sink
there
little
evidence
before
understanding
that
the
movement
pitcher
fastball
was
not
simply
endowment
nature
but
was
consequence
grip
release
and
spin
even
before
maris
time
pitchers
were
not
universally
capable
throwing
hard
fastball
with
movement
most
pitchers
had
either
speed
movement
but
not
both
modern
baseball
witness
the
four
seam
fastball
two
seam
fastball
cut
fastball
split
finger
fastball
sinking
fastball
slider
etc
all
which
can
thrown
with
devastatingly
fast
speed
hitters
must
able
keep
with
every
generation
that
passes
the
game
baseball
will
only
become
more
difficult
players
are
being
trained
harder
and
younger
ages
than
ever
before
mechanics
and
biomechanics
are
terms
that
every
and
coming
player
knows
about
which
brings
the
case
hitters
using
performance
enhancing
drugs
get
better
the
game
different
than
was
eighty
years
ago
babe
ruth
played
today
would
not
the
home
run
hitting
machine
was
his
bat
would
too
slow
his
eyes
wouldn
sharp
enough
and
wouldn
able
process
the
insane
combinations
speed
and
movement
pitches
hitters
today
however
are
able
why
because
they
have
been
raised
they
have
been
born
into
generation
which
the
competition
extreme
practice
makes
perfect
longer
the
adage
that
gets
you
the
big
leagues
gets
you
the
opportunity
considered
get
the
big
leauges
most
high
school
players
are
lucky
they
can
make
into
division
iii
perhaps
even
college
program
some
are
good
enough
even
get
drafted
into
the
minor
leagues
right
out
high
school
most
these
players
will
never
even
come
close
playing
major
league
baseball
furthermore
unlike
ruth
time
african
american
players
now
have
equal
opportunity
play
professionally
well
players
from
asia
and
latin
america
are
quite
prevalent
the
united
states
professional
system
the
point
competition
fierce
ever
exponentially
fiercer
than
ruth
time
and
will
only
become
more
this
why
many
players
turn
performance
enhancing

this
not

their
actions

they
are
playing
different

people

but
not

players
for
playing
during

times
they

they

their

right
wrong
that
the

mcgwire

his

twelve

the

mcgwire

because
his

did

use

during

career
what

must
look
the

the
time

mcgwire

baseball

traditional

definitely
not

variant
you
find
vegas
casinos
but
fun
game
that
sometimes
played
small
stakes
home
games
might
serve
you
well
know
the
basics
the
main
difference
from
regular
seven
card
stud
that
baseball
poker
involves
wild
cards
and
are
the
usual
wilds
and
players
who
are
dealt
face
get
option
buy
extra
card
given
free
depending
the
rules
some

the
queen

also
holds
special
significance
called
rain

baseball
there
also
poker
variant
called

baseball
like
seven

all
players
receive
seven

they
are
all
dealt
the

down
and
the
players
are
not
allowed
look
their
cards
just
like
baseball

are
wild

allow
you

the
dealer
starts
turning

clockwise
each

are

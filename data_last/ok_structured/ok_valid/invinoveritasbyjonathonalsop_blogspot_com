ways
hold
wine
glass
the
right
way
the
wrong
way
and
the
way
you
doing
keep
you
hands
the
stem
where
can
see
them
one
the
comic
and
frustrating
things
about
the
wine
world
trying
figure
out
you
doing
right
not
people
wonder
they
hurting
their
wine
not
letting
breathe
wine
lovers
know
they
being
judged
what
they
like
and
don
like
the
wine
world
not
alone
doing
this
and
they
drinking
the
right
wine
not
most
the
time
matter
what
you
you
left
feeling
like
you
doing
wrong
even
something
simple
holding
wine
glass
since
essentially
hold
wine
glass
while
talking
for
living
this
glass
handling
question
comes
lot
and
fair
say
pretty
familiar
with
all
the
different
ways
our
species
has
developed
get
wine
into
our
mouths
the
main
question
should
you
touch
the
glass
only
handle
the
glass
the
stem
and
doesn
warm
the
wine
when
you
touch
the
glass
and
mess
its
otherwise
perfect
temperature
much
maligned
much
smudging
there
question
you
could
warm
glass
wine
cupping
the
wine
your
hands
and
conducting
your
body
temperature
through
the
glass
not
sure
lot
this
happens
when
you
just
pick
wine
glass
normally
but
one
thing
that
does
happen
smudging
and
smearing
you
visually
oriented
person
this
can
mess
your
whole
visual
field
there
good
technical
reason
for
handling
the
wine
glass
only
the
stem
this
preserve
the
clarity
the
glass
and
wife
didn
hold
her
glass
this
way
how
would
able
tell
our
wine
glasses
apart
the
claw
pompous
unbearable
this
sometimes
finally
and
most
off
putting
all
the
ways
hold
wine
glass
the
claw
where
you
clasp
the
glass
firmly
the
base
and
hold
for
dear
life
have
confess
tend
fall
into
the
claw
from
time
time
maybe
rheumatism
acting
but
need
some
variety
after
hour
and
find
myself
clamped
down
like
this
sometimes
and
apologize
everyone
who
had
witness
know
you
wondering
can
that
really
how
supposed
hold
wine
glass
always
the
answer
try
all
the
different
ways
and
what
works
best
for
you
besides
what
you
when
you
confront
stemless
wine
glass

love
blended
wines
blending
sometimes
question
that
comes
wine
class
just
question
what
the
difference
between
pinot
noir
and
cabernet
where
rioja
located
spain
what
makes
red
wine
red
these
sorts
fact
based
detail
questions
can
relatively
easy
answer
least
easy
look
the
big
book
answers
also
know
the
oxford
companion
wine
which
any
time
need
now
and
then
wine
class
questions
can
get
little
more
complicated
saturday
night
during
wine
how
taste
wine
and
why
the
conversation
turned
blended
wines
and
someone
asked
love
blended
wine
and
the
question
surprised
little
embedded
within
this
question
the
idea
that
somehow
not
love
blended
wine
asked
what
wrong
with
blended
wine
you
the
math
learned
uncertain
terms
that
the
majority
these
wine
lovers
even
the
beginning
their
wine
educations
had
picked
the
notion
that
blended
wines
are
cheaper
lower
quality
just
generally
not
good
wines
that
are
made
from
one
grape
truth
some
the
planet
most
famous
most
expensive
most
sought
after
wines
bordeaux
chianti
rioja
chateauneuf
pape
and
more
are
blended
wines
and
have
been
for
long
time
the
short
answer
that
more
than
really
love
blended
wines
your
taste
never
wrong
and
whatever
wine
you
love
that
exactly
what
you
supposed
doing

top
things
you
need

about
every

wine
you
drink
there
are
thousand
different
things
know
about

wine
like
atomic
particles
each
little
bit
information
has
its
own
weight
approximately
this
order
once
you
know
these
three
things
about
wine
you
can
forward
good
conscience
most
important
info
back
the
place
sometimes
you
look
and
you
never
heard
sometimes
you
look
and
you
say
mancha
like
don
quixote
and
that
why
you
look
the
grape
even
the
grape
name
completely
unknown
you
you
can
least
ask
someone
wine
shop
murfatlar
how
much
like
pinot
grigio
that
and
start
conversation
the
year
general
rule
drink
white

overwhelmingly
young
habit
that
when
comes
red

almost
anything
goes
except

wines
you
never
heard
first
off
let
talk
about
this
word
new
and
what
means
the
wine
world
like
many
wine
words
can
mean
whatever
you
want
whether
historically
new
stylistically
new
just
never
heard
before
which
what
talking
about
most
the
time
white
wine
for
red
wine
lovers
all
the
wines
use
class
for
the
best
new
wines
you
never
heard
are
new
different
ways
the
grapes
are
not
necessarily
new
the
timeline
history
couple
them
are
new
where
they
grown
but
the
others
have
been
place
hundreds
maybe
thousands
years

when
might

were
pinot
grigio
something
this
delicious
zesty
white
wine
made
think
pears
and
although
very
zippy
and
citrusy
the
flavor
overall
deep
and
dense
and
some
the
experience
reminded
red

there
more
than
one
thing
going

beautiful

aroma
exotic
that
feel
like
could
just
spend
the
whole
day
looking
and
smelling
and
almost
never
having
drink
although
that
not
going
happen
for
once
the
name
the
wine
marketed
under
wildflower
accurate
every
way
and
tells
you
everything
you
need
know
about
what

tuesday

twilight
the
wine
bottles
just
the
other
day
wine
party
fell
into
another
fevered
conversation
about
cork
versus
screwcap
versus
synthetic
cork
versus
whatever
but
isn
cork
better
isn
screwcap
better
even
screwcap
really
better
doesn
cork
better
job
saying
you
care
date
least
was
still
young
and
good
looking
and
trying
meet
women
would
definitely
wait
until
the
seventh
date
break
out
the
screwcap
wine
but
that
just
bottle
cork
screwcap
problem
right
the
middle
this
meeting
the
slightly
intoxicated
minds
showed
off
sample
someone
had
sent
just
that
day
stack
wines
charisma
four
glasses
wine
four
stemless
plastic
wine
glasses
stacked
one
top
the
other
the
conversation
changed
utterly
what
were
talking
about
again
nothing
because
the
bottle
goes
away
the
irresistible
but
false
dichotomy
cork
versus
screwcap
goes
away
too

monday

just
around
the
corner
love
with
white
wine
the
history
wine
the
history
people
saying
will
never
work
just
years
ago
california
wine
was
but
not
thought
lot
people
real
wine
sure
you
could
drink
but
was
special
occasion
you
always
with
the
euro
option
until
well
into
the
washington
state
and
oregon
have
been
adventure
until
the
last
decade
and
this
very
moment
write
that
north
carolina
and
virginia
are
going
big
like
oregon
and
washington
the
not
too
distant
future
someone
somewhere
saying
out
loud
probably
north
carolina
wine
never
happen
let
not
even
talk
about
china
worth
remembering
that
the
ancient
romans
said
exactly
the
same
thing
about
france
granted
took
thousand
years
but
they
were
still
wrong
just
like
are
wrong
today
when
kind
default
look
sideways
local
wine
love
everything
else
local
but
appear
trapped
perfect
negative
fusion
snobbery
and
america
euro
inferiority
complex
that
makes
impossible
perceive
first
anyway
how
good
our
local
wines
are
too
quality
and
emotional
quality

than

called

wine
and
water
four
grape
blend
still
mostly
water
one
the
questions
that
comes
wine
class
over
and
over
again
why
wine
very
hard
for
lot
people
describe
after
get
past
the
first
obvious
exclamations
like
love
and
hate
damn
that
yummy
and
why
are
you
doing
this
many
wine
lovers
get
bogged
down
trying
say
more
there
are
about
many
reasons
for
this
there
are
wine
lovers
but
most
folks
start
out
blaming
themselves
only
they
were
smarter
born
rich
and
classy
had
better
palates
whatever
that
means
talking
about
wine
would
much
easier
sometimes
the
intimidation
factor
reaches
such
fever
pitch
that
they
conclude
not
without
some
pretty
good
reasons
that
wine
tasting
just
gigantic
load
crap
whipped
wine
snobs
make
the
rest
the
world
feel
small
and
stupid
see
wine
tasting
bullshit
here
why
for
romping
overview
this
world
view
truth
wine
challenge
describe
because
wine
overwhelmingly
water
odorless
colorless
and
flavorless
general
dry
white
wine
about
percent
alcohol
plus
less
than
percent
acidity
and
another
percent
other
compounds
that
makes
around
percent
water
the
flavor
equivalent
nothing
think
this
way
wine
were
another
kind
art
painting
for
example
would
more
than
three
quarters
blank
canvas
and
just
tiny
bit
paint

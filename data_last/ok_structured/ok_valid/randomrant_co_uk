michael
purchased
set
irons
online
year
ago
that
were
supposedly
legitimate
thought
got
great
deal
but
when
they
arrived
and
opened
the
box
instantly
realized
they
were
fake
definitely
wasn
the
best
deal
thought
would
ben
recently
purchased
two
single
irons
and
that
were
supposedly
legitimate
from
website
after
hitting
them
today
can
safely
say
they
aren
the
real
deal
disappointing
really
want
buy
complete
set
but
saw
this
chance
chip
away
getting
whole
set
sick
these
counterfeiters
making
money
off
people
like
this
steve
received
golf
club
ordered
online
but
after
son
was
looking
forward
owning
and
using
are
very
disappointed
find
out
that
this
actually
fake
copy
our
golf
professional
pointed
out
and
confirmed
numerous
fake
aspects
the
club
and
the
fact
that
would
never
hold
any
sale
exchange
value
even
though
the
actual
price
that
paid
was
very
good
thought
were
buying
the
real
thing
this
appears
have
been
shipped
direct
from
china
though
were
under
the
impression
that
had
bought
america
mike
received
pair
clubs
gift
from
wife
for
our
first
anniversary
not
being
golfer
she
asked
friends
what
wanted
and
then
went
online
searching
for
the
best
deal
and
ordered
set
that
appeared
legit
unfortunately
soon
opened
the
clubs
was
clear
that
they
were
counterfeits
spent
approximately
weeks
emailing
the
company
trying
get
return
refund
processed
and
thus
far
have
received
partial
refund
but
working
getting
the
rest
straightened
out
more
importantly
like
what
can
stop
sites
like
this
that
one
else
runs
into
situation
like
mine
patrick
the
site
states
that
they
are
based
the
and
selling
genuine
clubs
and
sadly
was
lured
purchasing
driver
and
wood
from
them
the
clubs
are
nothing
like
the
site
states
and
far
from
anything
real
manufacturer
would
sell
will
certainly
not
lured
again
and
next
purchase
will
direct
from
registered
retailer

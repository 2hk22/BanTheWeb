approach
was
different
first
checked
physical
state
health
next
asked
very
carefully
what
wanted
achieve
before
even
holding
club
having
seen
swing
kept
the
message
simple
and
direct
proved
after
minutes
visible
change
the
result
what
happens
long
term
depends
not
him
but
how
much
effort
and
time
willing
invest

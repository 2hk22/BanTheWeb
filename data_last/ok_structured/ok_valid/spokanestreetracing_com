apple
opened

according
some

apple
has
made
biometrics
unsafe
for
everyone
android

that
wanted

you
find
remarkable
that

not
software
but
they
doubted
that
the
fingerprint
really
remains

unit

the

the

according

the

sensor
will
not
outdone
android
devices
the
really
good
fingerprint
sensor
touch
was
overcome
within
few
hours
the
hackers
expect
that
android
devices
will
use
sensor
with
even
lower
resolution
than
touch
addition
they
not
believe
that
the
comparatively
expensive
chip
technology
from
apple
will
used
save
few
pennies
the
fingerprint
checking
will
work
via
software
rather
cloud
application
remarkably
the
fingerprint
technology
was
popular
almost
ten
years
ago
and
unlikely
happens
again
apple
have
thus
opened
the
pandora
box
for
the

paved
the
way

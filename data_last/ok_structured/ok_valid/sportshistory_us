while

literally
the
other
side
the
world
from
march
madness
was
looking
for
new
way
conducting

stumbled
upon
the
auction

numerous
advantages
over
traditional
office
pools
easy
set

extremely
fun

the

their

were
two
bubbles
forming
the

the

both
burst
quickly
and
both
are

there
are
numerous

because
they

baseball
creates

baseball

are
more

baseball
adheres

these

are
just
about
ready
take
dip
punta
bay
maribojoc
where
the
famous
punta
cruz
watch
tower
just
nearby
the
beach
okay
for
swimming
and
because
waves
can
bigger
compared
the
beaches
panglao
adds
the
fun
little
kids
and
toddlers
may
not
like
get
splashed
over
their
heads
though
they
should
just
stay
near
the
shore
the
beach
bit
rocky
but
the
rocks
are
relatively
smooth
they
are
not
much
hassle
punta
bay
alternative
beach
area
with
smaller
crowd
because
less
known
compared
the

panglao
also
suspect
the

area
might
good
dive
spot
but
haven
tried

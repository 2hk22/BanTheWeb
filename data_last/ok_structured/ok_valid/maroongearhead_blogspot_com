the
blog
some
aggie
race
fans
two
aggies
discuss
racing
not
insiders
just
outsiders
with
opinions
sunday
september
this
gettting
silly
reports
this
week
are
that
petty
enterprises
mean
gillet
evernham
motorsports
that
paid
richard
petty
lot
money
rename
their
team
richard
petty
motorsports
now
merging
with
the
organization
formerly
known
robert
yates
racing
maybe
the
new
organization
will
called
egyp
racing
the
competition
this
sport
has
become
farce
there
hendrick
motorsports
who
dominates
couple
teams
like
gibbs
and
rousch
fighting
for
second
and
bunch
teams
fighting
for
scraps
the
smartest
thing
tony
stewart
did
was
affiliate
himself
with
hendrick
for
his
sake
hope
does
not
become
the
hendrick
program

saturday
may
wish
mike
joy
would
stop
apologizing
for
the
france
family
this
sort
minor
complaint
but
think
some
people
namely
the
schills
fox
sports
are
dowplaying
the
seriousness
what
happened
talladega
last
week
case
anyone
has
forgotten
people
were
injured
when
carl
edwards
car
went
airborne
and
hit
the
catchfence
scattering
debris
into
the
fans
this
week
richmond
during
the
pre
race
the
issue
came
darrell
waltrip
and
larry
mcreynolds
tried
dismiss
saying
that
edwards
car
wouldn
have
gotten
airborne
ryan
newman
hadn
hit
him
fat
lot
good
that
statement
was
maybe
when
nascar
unveils
the
car
tomorrow
they
can
design
magic
feature
cars
don
bump
into
each
other
worse
yet
mike
joy
dismissed
the
injuries
minor
hmmm
one
teenage
girl
was
the
hospital
for
three
days
while
her
jaw
was
being
reconstructed
doubt
her
jaw
probably
wired
shut
and
she
eats
through
straw
these
days
while
television
personalities
merrily
flap
their
gums
thankfully
for
her
she
not
announcing
sporting
events
like
joy
liked
mike
joy
lot
better
when
was
cbs
and
wasn
glossing
over
serious

long
live
the
king
ever
since
realized
you
could
race
cars
was
richard
petty
fan
started
one
summer
the
early
when
was
cousin
house
and
had
afx
slot
car
track
with
box
full
cars
put
two
cars
the
slots
pull
the
trigger
hard
you
could
and
hope
the
car
didn
fly
off
the
track
when
you
hit
the
corner
the
closest
thing
real
racing
jackie
stewart
told
for
you
readers
who
may
not
have
heard
formula
the
jackie
not
related
tony
stewart
one
them
scale
cars
was
sporty
blue
road
runner
with
sidepipes
and
painted
the
side
that
richard
petty
car
cousin
told
won
more
races
than
anyone
other
cousin
told
they
call
him
king
richard
brother
said
from
then
was
race
fan
and
richard
petty
fan
didn
get
much
nascar
news
central
texas
the
indy
was
usually
broadcast
tape
delay
back
then
and
wondered
why
richard
petty
wasn
that
was
though
because
rooted
for
foyt
just
the
same
was
from
houston
had
won
indy
and
and
that
was
cool
still
like
not
long
after
got
see
the
daytona
you
know
the
one
the
one
where
cale
yarborough
and
the
the
alabama
gang
fought
the
back
stretch
while
king
richard
went
win
his
daytona
when
finally
started
being
able
attend
races
live
hey
fireball
doowah
and
buddies
kept
that
sentimental
attachment
the
even
though
knew
wasn
doing
that
well
over
the
years
that
seat
has
been
occupied
long
list
meh
drivers
lots
potential
but
little
payoff
when
heard
bobby
labonte
was
going
drive
the
got
excited
hot
damn
former
winston
cup
champion
and
guy
from
texas
boot
while
the
team
enjoyed
little
bit
resurgence
the
overall
results
were
still
unremarkable
sadly
bobby
hamilton
and
john
anderetti
have
more
wins
the
car
than
bobby
labonte
does
now
richard
petty
has
sold
controlling

petty

boston

boston

has
unceremoniously
fired
kyle
petty
bobby
labonte
has
left
the
team
for
lack

this

petty

has
laid
off

now
there
reported

evernham
motorsposrts
gem
for
the

can
figure
out
what
gem
wants
with
struggling

slow

empty

guess
the
only
thing
value
left
petty
the

who
knew
being
engineer
one
could
say
fan
numbers
but
numerology
not
much
which
brings
rambling
yearly
post
this
blog
numerology
complete
hocus
pocus
like
think
mark
martin
years
frustration
not
winning
championship
was
related
the
unholy
number
but
skeptical
and
any
sane
person
would
call
the
number
and
the
number
the
same
certainly
wouldn
confuse
clint
bowyer
and
robby
gordon
sure
might
confuse
their
respective
sponsors
there
really
any
difference
between
jack
daniels
and
jim
beam
and
who
hired
these
marketing
geniuses
differentiate
the
respective
brands
yesterday
reading
story
about
nazi
skinhead
who
plotting
national
killing
spree
that
would
include
sen
obama
what
found
most
interesting
was
the
significance
the
number
which
apparently
white
supremacist
symbol
that
also
stands
for
heil
hitler
since
the
letter
the
alphabet
certainly
wouldn
denigrate
any
dale
fans
but
personally
have
hard
time
wearing
number
for
fear
that
some
stupid
ass
nazi
skinhead
would
confuse
hate

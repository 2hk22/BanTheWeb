ode
motsuni
every
often
life
you
come
across
something
that
really
makes
you
happy
something
that
gives
you
warm
feeling
inside
and
puts
goofy
smile
your
face
the
moment
you
think
about
say
name
out
loud
and
suddenly
the
sun
comes
out
the
clouds
away
and
little
blue
birds
appear
and
start
singing
the
song
zippedydoodah
for
some
people
this
happy
thought
might
place
thing
even
person
case
japanese
dish
made
out
pig
intestines
and
other
internal
organs
stewed
together
yes
friends
this
ode
motsuni
now
can
really
say
expert
motsuni
since
only
had
few
times
several
times
akitaya
once
masuya
and
once
the
kawagoe
matsuri
masuya
motsuni
was
not
the
greatest
sorry
kenjisan
the
kawagoe
matsuri
ate
motsuni
outdoor
beer
garden
this
motsuni
had
more
vegetables
than
the
others
tried
was
also
filled
with
black
tripe
and
other
unidentifiable
bits
pig
innard
goodies
would
call
this
motsuni
close
second
akitaya
didn
take
picture
the
motsuni
had
kawagoe
but
found
the
above
picture
and
looks
pretty
close
including
the
styrofoam
bowl
came
friend
timmy
has
love
hate
relationship
with
motsuni
agrees
with
wholeheartedly
that
very
tasty
dish
that
goes
well
with
beer
and
shochu
but
obvious
that
this
fat
free
dish
some
may
even
argue
that
eating
stewed
pig
innards
could
bad
for
you
the
last
time
had
akitaya
encouraged
timmy
drink
all
the
leftover
oily
broth
and
bits
fat
that
had
collected
the
bottom
his
bowl
timmy
obliged
the
time
without
hesitation
but
now
claims
coerced
him
into
doing
further
claims
that
this
was
attempt
slowly
kill
him
clogging
his
arteries
with
pork
fat

harajuku
boy
sure
many
you
have
heard
gwen
stefani
song
harajuku
girls
well
meet
friend
richard
the
real
harajuku
boy
part
our
mission
japan
this
year
was
find
store
called
bape
harajuku
tokyo
for
the
uninitiated
harajuku
the
fashion
mecca
japan
and
friend
rich
was
determined
experience
shopping
really
cool
store
called
bape
told
that
bape
stands
for
bathing
ape
but
have
clue
why
named
prior
visiting
all
knew
was
that
bape
was
going
have
really
cool
hip
hop
and
urban
street
clothes
for
sale
and
that
friend
rich
really
wanted
visit
you
would
think
that
popular
store
like
bape
would
very
easy
find
right
wrong
they
had
this
place
hidden
better
than
jimmy
hoffa
walked
past
this
place
over
and
over
before
rich
finally
peeked
over
the
railing
and
spotted
downstairs
take
look
this
picture
and
tell
you
could
tell
that
bape
located
down
the
flight
stairs
with
the
white
hand
railing
bape
not
the
store
you
see
the
street
level
when
you
walk
literally
hidden
downstairs
now
hindsight
this
actually
makes
some
sense
since
the
directions
were
getting
from
nearby
shop
owners
always
had
something
with
going
down
the
time
assumed
going
down
meant
going
down
the
street
not
going
down
some
stairs
the
street
level
store
that
was
above
bape
was
the
billionaire
boys
club
according
rich
this
another
hip
store
that
actually
has
connection
bape
was
really
glad
that
rich
was
able
shop
bape
myself
actually
much
too
hip
truly
appreciate
what
they
sell
there
any
place
that
sells
camouflaged
boxer
shorts
for
bucks
piece
definitely
not
the
kind
place
that
usually
shop
you
were
ask
impression
bape
would
tell
you
remember
ape
face
lot
camouflaged
items
and
everything
priced
with
way
too
many
zeros
after
guess

the
dog
bar
masuya
during
our
trip
tokyo
would
often
walk
this
izakaya
our
way
home
from
the
train
station
during
the
day
dog
would
always
sleeping
out
front
the
shop
when
passed
because
didn
know
the
actual
name
the
place
few
started
referring
the
dog
bar
because
the
ever
present
sleeping
dog
turns
out
the
place
actually
called
masuya
which
has
nothing
with
dogs
figure
well
for
one
reason
another
were
never
able
stop
off
for
food
and
drinks
here
but
vowed
visit
during
our
next
trip
japan
kept
our
promise
and
finally
went
for
visit
you
look
real
good
you
can
see
timmy
standing
off
the
far
right
the
picture
with
beer
hand
usual
you
haven
already
noticed
from
previous
postings
like
drink
outside
here
are
standing
outside
masuya
the
crisp
night
air
good
friends
enjoying
tasty
beverage
together
while
watching
the
world
walk
sightseeing
and
culture
aside
this
the
reason
enjoy
traveling
japan
previous
posting
about
akitaya
mentioned
how
they
stacked
table
tops
beer
crates
outside
for
masuya
they
used
these
cool
blue
gallon
drums
instead
the
food
was
pretty
good
and
the
sake
was
even
better
timmy
his
usual
fashion
had
quickly
made
friends
with
our
bald
headed
waiter
named
kenji
kenji
san
took
very
good
care
which
was
probably
due
timmy
good
looks
and
boyish
charm
ordered
some
sake
from
kenji
and
poured
for
like
was
free
now
pretty
common
for
japanese
restaurants
place
your
sake
glass
into
wooden
masu
and
purposely
over
pour
the
sake
until
overflows
from
the
glass
into
the
masu
sign
hospitality
and
that
little
bit
over
pour
makes
you
feel
that
you
are
getting
your
money
worth
well
kenji
san
not
only
overflowed
our
glasses
also
overflowed
our
masu
onto
the
table
using
some
quick
bar
math
came
the
conclusion
that
each
had
received
the
equivalent
three
glasses
sake
each
you
don
believe
take
look
the
picture
above
masuya
location
afforded
beautiful
view
tokyo
tower
which
you
can
see
the
background
this
picture
and
that
shady
looking
character
the
background
timmy
when
first
took
this
picture
was
pretty
pleased
with
myself
having
positioned
mug
beer
against
the
night
sky
with
beautiful
full
moon
and
tokyo
tower
behind
was
only
when
looked
this
picture
the
next
day
that
realized
that
beautiful
full
moon
was
actually
the
glowing
sign
the
chinese
restaurant
next
door
guess
kenji
san
really
did
pour
lot
sake
that
night

yoshinoya
breakfast
champions
been
wanting
this
post
since
our
trip
tokyo
and
finally
got
around
welcome
ode
yoshinoya
younger
sister
once
teased
because
liked
eating
yoshinoya
when
visited
japan
why
would
you
want
eat
there
she
asked
when
mentioned
having
breakfast
there
few
times
established
yoshinoya
the
name
the
largest
gyudon
beef
bowl
restaurant
chain
japan
considered
fast
food
japan
beef
bowl
gyudon
basically
bowl
rice
covered
with
pieces
thinly
sliced
beef
and
sometimes
onion
the
beef
and
onions
are
usually
kept
simmering
their
own
sauce
which
allows
them
served
quickly
when
order
placed
hence
the
reference
fast
food
there
was
yoshinoya
located
about
block
from
our
hotel
and
ate
there
few
times
for
breakfast
understand
there
are
over
locations
alone
japan
while
they
definitely
don
serve
the
same
kind
food
guess
sister
puts
yoshinoya
the
same
category
mcdonalds
which
why
she
was
amused
that
would
fly
all
the
way
japan
basically
eat
fast
food
joint
the
united
staes
you
can
even
buy
gyudon
your
frozen
food
section
well
hawaii
least
just
pop
the
microwave
and
you
good
truly
enjoyed
having
breakfast
yoshinoya
during
our
trip
always
been
breakfast
guy
who
prefers
something
savory
opposed
sweet
pancakes
fruits
for
give
plate
salty
breakfast
meats
eggs
and
rice
and
happy
camper
throw
some
miso
soup
and
some
pickled
vegetables
and
heaven
side
note
ironically
all
had
some
type
pork
bowl
opposed
beef
bowl
the
time
our
trip
turns
out
that
yoshinoya
was
not
serving
any
beef
while
were
there
apparantly
yoshinoya
buys
the
majority
beef
from
the
united
states
when
japan
banned
the
import
american
beef
due
mad
cow
disease
yoshinoya
was
forced
stop
selling
beef
bowls
understand
that
the
ban
was
lifted
and
that
yoshinoya
has
resumed
selling
beef
bowls
but
very
limted
basis
figure

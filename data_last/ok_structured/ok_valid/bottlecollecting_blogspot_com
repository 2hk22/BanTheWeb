tough
stuff
the
world
miniature
beer
bottle
collecting
isn
hard
pick
blatz
schlitz
pabst
blue
ribbon
for
your
collection
just
quick
search
ebay
and
you
know
what
talking
about
after
you
have
been
collecting
these
things
for
while
not
too
hard
create
rather
nice
collection
consisting
some
moderately
hard
find
bottles
such
crystal
rock
red
ribbon
tip
top
fehr
manhattan
and
many
others
once
you
have
these
bottles
you
probably
find
yourself
lusting
for
more
that
point
prepare
break
out
your
checkbook
the
next
level
toughies
will
tax
your
bank
account
that
assumes
you
will
even
have
the
chance
purchase
one
these
rarities
enter
the
elusive
manru
lager
this
beauty
super
tough
and
some
consider
the
pinnacle
the
hobby
known
exist
all
three
common
sizes
and
here
have
the
version
affectionately
known
stubby
manru
lager
was
brewed
the
schreiber
brewing
company
buffalo
new
york
our
next
toughie
one
kind
well
least
only
one
known
exist
this
point
submitted
for
your
approval
the
wholesome
beer
perhaps
one
the
most
interesting
mini
beers
have
surfaced
long
time
first
the
label
decal
which
makes
very
hard
fake
notice
the
size
this
bottle
stands
unusual
tall
after
some
rather
extensive
research
the
verdict
this
was
prototype
bottle
used
pitch
the
concept
putting
your
brand
miniature
bottle
the
glass
owens
illinois
much
like
many
mini
beers
such
ambrosia
nectar
and
frederick
crown
very
tough
bottle
its
own
right
fact
the
color
scheme
the
wholesome
beer
the
same
the
aforementioned
minis
next
the
internal
revenue
tax
paid
statement
dates
the
bottle
somewhere
between
and
the
funny
thing
about
this
bottle
the
wholesome
brewing
company
never
existed
however
the
unknown
maker
this
bottle
went
great
pains
get
the
content
alcohol
percentage
and
irtp
statement
accurate
when
you
find
yourself
searching
antique
store
more
likely
ebay
keep
your
eyes
peeled

german
giveaways
porcelain
primer
you
may
know
these
bottles
under
one
variety
names
giveaways
german
giveaways
german
porcelains
nips
nippers
grotesques
etc
you
surely
free
call
them
whatever
you
want
however
they
were
manufactured
germany
and
many
were
produced
the
firm
schafer
and
vater
which
began
sometime
from
and
closed
its
doors
possibly
late
these
bottles
though
date
from
the
the
that
there
seems
general
agreement
among
collectors
the
bottles
are
found
the
united
states
the
united
kingdom
and
france
but
yet
are
unknown
germany
they
come
variety
sizes
from
just
few
inches
well
over
foot
they
are
found
both
high
glaze
and
bisque
and
multi
color
blue
brown
gray
and
occasional
green
this
time
will
look
two
brown
and
two
blue
there
really
very
little
tell
the
bottles
speak
for
themselves
some
these
will
the
rarest
occasions
found
with
paper
label
more
will
discovered
have
the
name
bar
restaurant
etched
into
the
porcelain
the
bars
prior
prohibition
which
used
them
and
have
allowed
now
have
some
delightful
collectibles
bars
would
use
these
gifts
and
most
often
gave
them
away
usually
christmas
you
were
habitual
elbow
bender
you
probably
got
the
quart
size
with
without
music
box
base
naturally
this
bottle
was
then
filled
with
the
bar
whiskey
you
were
less
regular
attendee
you
got
smaller
size
for
many
the
styles
there
were
five
different
sizes
for
our
purposes
though
these
are
the
smallest
size
each
these

what
night
those
you
who
collect
the
german
porcelains
giveaway
bottles
are
quite
familiar
with
the
larger
flasks
with
the
thermometers
drinkometers
they
are
known
the
bottles
the
idea
was
hold
your
thumb
forefinger
against
the
bottom
the
thermometer
and
you
could
measure
how
many
drinks
you
could
should
have
had
already
imbibed
the
man
toasting
the
doctor
docter
sic
and
the
old
man
are
the
three
commonly
seen
this
one
not
all
well
known
and
very
seldom
seen
what
night
common
slogan
these
bottles
and
can
found
short
pocket
flask
well
the
figural
already
seen
here
this
site
this
fellow
definitely
has
had
quite
night
the
dancing
bottles
gin
whisky
and
scotch
attest
the
other
side
the
bottle
find
the
new
thermometer
which
has
replaced
the
original
and
the
weather
forecast
just
guess
but
could
that
forecast
have
anything
with
what
the
weather
would
like
when
this

his

the
snake
there
are
many
different
types
german
giveaways
have
flasks
both
large
and
small
wonderful
figurals
with
music
box
bases
clever
characters
doing
naughty
things
and
occasionally
something
different
the
snake
bottle
pictured
here
yes
his
head
the
stopper
seldom
seen
many
respects
you
really
think
about
the
bottle
somewhat
figural
flask
doesn
hold
much
probably
wasn
too
popular
among
the
larger
imbibers
but
also

knock
off
rip
off
can
you
say
rip
off
through
the
years
read
many
articles
about
shady
fly
bynight
companies
various
third
world
countries
which
don
exactly
counterfeit
famous
labels
but
surely
make
them
similar
seen
pictures
imitation
johnnie
walker
red
and
gordon
gin
however
now
never
seen
mini
imitation
this
martell
knock
off
was
produced
probably
and
was
sold
mexico
you
traveled
down
there
lived
there
you
just
might
grab
this
off
the
shelf
and
think
you
got
the
real
thing
the
company
which
produced
anglo
swiss
vintager
also
made
great
many
tequilas
rums
and
even
marvelous
set
ceramics
this
one
though
certainly
less
anspicious
just
goes
prove
that
imitation
isn
necessarily
the
sincerest
form
flattery

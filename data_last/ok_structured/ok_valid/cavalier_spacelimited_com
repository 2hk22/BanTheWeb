charlie
takes
her
bath
every
saturday
morning
yes
once
week
she
loves
bathing
and
would
sit
the
tub
very
still
while
clean
her
with
lukewarm
water
from
the
shower
when
bathing
charlie
would
also
talk
her
and
how
she
loves
the
attention
whenever
said
charlie
shake
shake
charlie
would
shake
vigorously
rid
herself
excess
water
experimented
with
various
types
doggie
shampoo
but
have
yet
discover
the
best
charlie
seems
feel
itchier
few
days
following
her
bath
have
tried
everything
from
organic
shampoo
oatmeal
shampoo
all
types
moisturizing
shampoo
dry
charlie
put
her
her
cage
which
lined
with
two
towels
and
blow
her
fur
with
hairdryer
charlie
was
always
cooperative
and
would
roll
the
towel
get
the
excess
water
off
after
while
she
would
totally
dry
with
beautiful
fluffy
fur
which
also
smells
terrific
when
all
that
done
charlie
would
drag
her
towels
out
the
cage
and
bring
them
away
play
and
chew
she
loves
play
with
towels
some
believe
that
dogs
should
not
bathed
too
often
maybe
twice
month
once
month
but
charlie
tends
smell
little
off
approaching
one
week
after
her
bath
since
our
sofa
and
cushions
are
her
favorite
spots
for
naps
must
make
sure
that
she
kept
rather
clean
when
are
resting
charlie
would
always
climb
right
and
settle
down
our
chest
lap
for
nap
cavaliers
are
extremely
sensitive
dogs
who
are
aware
their
owner
feelings
they
are
also
very
communicative
ours

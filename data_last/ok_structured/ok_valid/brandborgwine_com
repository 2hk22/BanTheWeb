unique
and
deserving
this
differentiation
while
wholly
within
the
umpqua
valley
ava
and
the
much
larger
southern
oregon
ava
the
climate
elkton
very
different
from
the
prevailing
perceptions
these
areas
most
tend
think
all
southern
oregon
warmer
and
drier
than
the
better
known
areas
the
north
elkton
the
main
umpqua
river
which
flows
through
valley
opening
the
pacific
only
miles
away
and
only
feet
lower
elevation
this
geography
allows
for
very
strong
marine
influence
with
daily
sea
breezes
and
fog
penetrating
into
the
valley
this
gives
elkton
its
unique
climate
cool
maritime
and
temperate
ideal
for
the
varieties
that
ken
first
planted
are
all
thankful

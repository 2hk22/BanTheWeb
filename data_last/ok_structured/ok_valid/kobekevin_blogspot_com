constant
questioning
raising
bilingual
child
teaching
tip
constant
questioning
learned
lot
working
kindergarten
teacher
for
five
years
closely
observed
students
and
watched
their
parents
carefully
well
asked
students
about
their
interactions
with
their
parents
they
read
stories
you
you
sit
together
family
and
eat
meals
together
when
you
get
home
from
school
you
mostly
watch
television
play
with
your
parents
when
your
parents
take
you
the
park
they
play
with
you
sit
and
watch
you
learned
lot
about
what
parent
and
most
importantly
what
not
simply
put
many
parents
don
talk
their
children
they
may
bark
commands
them
from
time
time
even
talk
them
they
were
babies
but
many
don
engage
them
one
school
worked
teachers
would
take
their
classes
large
public
park
each
morning
and
play
playground
often
saw
parents
who
would
take
their
child
there
let
the
child
play
themselves
while
she
just
sat
bench
with
coffee
and
stared
their
smart
phone
other
times
group
mothers
would
take
their
children
the
park
and
then
ignore
them
they
saw
social
time
for
mommy
opposed
playtime
and
learning
time
for
their
child
summer
insect
hunt
with
son
all
parents
are
guilty
letting
their
kids
watch
little
too
much
television
especially
when
you
trying
cook
dinner
clean
the
house
guilty
that
well
also
find
myself
time
not
engaging
kids
much
probably
should
luckily
tend
snap
out
and
realize
that
need
interact
more
constantly
questioning
your
child
great
way
engage
them
constantly
asking
them
mixture
closed
and
open
ended
questions
about
what
they
are
doing
and
the
world
around
them
helps
them
develop
critical
thinking
skills
well
their
language
when
for
walk
with
son
often
find
myself
asking
him
wide
variety
questions
about
everything
around
here
example
hey
kai
what
that
pointing
leaf
ground
son
leaf
what
color
son
brown
why
brown
son
dirty
brown
because
old
and
dry
why
the
sidewalk
son
cause
the
tree
broken
and
the
leaf
jumped
the
leaf
didn
jump
off
the
tree
fell
off
can
you
say
fell
off
the
tree
son
fell
the
tree
that
exchange
asked
him
variety
questions
also
corrected
his
logic
and
language
when
said
the
leaf
jumped
off
the
tree
course
always
correct
him
nice
way
correcting
children
grammar
and
vocabulary
usage
something
some
parents
don
enough
that
can
definitely
lead
fossilization
speaking
errors
that
for
another
post
remember
you
parent
kids
who
are
the
developmental
stages
language
acquisition
question
them
lot
you
are
teacher
the
same
even
children
are
older
and
their
language
developed
constantly
questioning
them
you
are
encouraging
them
think
and
always
acting
teacher
that
good
thing
don
forget

scariest
bugs
japan
scariest
insects
japan
top
list
realize
that
not
all
are
technically
bugs
recently
was
asked
question
youtube
facebook
page
about
creepy
crawly
things
someone
who
plans
move
japan
shared
with
that
they
are
very
frightened
spiders
and
fear
they
may
have
allergy
they
wondered
there
are
many
spiders
one
should
fear
japan
think
most
adults
come
across
japan
have
fear
bugs
some
extent
when
talk
about
adults
course
referring
both
japanese
and
non
japanese
often
that
fear
seems
pretty
irrational
many
people
tell
they
don
like
insects
simply
because
the
way
they
look
also
for
many
these
bug
haters
there
must
have
been
some
sort
change
attitude
during
their
lives
say
that
because
most
children
meet
like
bugs
catching
cicadas
grasshoppers
and
mantises
one
the
most
popular
summertime
hobbies
japanese
children
some
point
though
many
turn
from
bug
fans
bug
fearers
self
described
insect
fan
have
been
teaching
son
not
fear
but
enjoy
insects
the
same
time
however
realize
that
there
are
some
dangerous
insects
japan
there
are
some
bugs
that
one
should
touch
have
also
been
trying
teach
son
that
well
here
short
list
and
little
information
about
some
the
most
dangerous
and
freaky
insects
japan
particular
order
japanese
giant
hornet
suzumebachi
found
throughout
japan
the
giant
hornet
can
long
with
wingspan
these
are
very
powerful
and
aggressive
creatures
pretty
much
the
top
the
food
chain
japan
preying
upon
almost
any
other
insect
out
there
japan
they
are
known
the
osuzumaebachi
which
literally
translates
giant
sparrow
bee
although
they
can
found
cities
they
are
most
commonly
found
rural
areas
the
giant
hornets
dismember
their
victims
with
their
powerful
jaws
said
that
their
saliva
and
venom
have
the
ability
dissolve
flesh
their
venom
extremely
powerful
and
injected
through
quarter
inch
stinger
their
sting
extremely
painful
and
requires
hospital
treatment
they
are
considered
the
most
dangerous
animal
japan
with
more
than
people
dying
each
year
anaphylactic
shock
after
having
been
stung
bears
kill
and
venomous
snakes
only
about
per
year
japanese
centipede
mukade
these
fairly
reclusive
creatures
tend
stay
dark
damp
places
they
can
grow
length
and
are
extremely
quick
and
nimble
creatures
they
are
certainly
horrifying
appearance
when
full
grown
and
are
venomous
bites
from
large
japanese
centipede
are
very
painful
and
may
cause
swelling
weakness
fever
their
bites
are
normally
not
fatal
but
some
people
have
allergies
centipede
venom
assassin
bug
sashigame
assassin
bugs
can
found
many
parts
japan
they
tend
slowly
move
around
trees
and
are
capable
clumsy
style
flight
although
they
seem
normally
move
slowly
they
can
quickly
strike
their
prey
they
use
long
rostrum
injector
inject
lethal
saliva
that
liquefies
the
insides
the
prey
which
are
then
sucked
out
the
saliva
contains
enzymes
that
predigest
the
tissues
they
swallow
this
very
effective
when
attacking
prey
that
are
much
larger
than
the
bug
itself
bite
from
this
relatively
small
bug
can
extremely
painful
especially
for
child
although
not
extremely
dangerous
humans
their
bite
will
cause
pain
and
swelling
really
big
ouchie
caterpillars
various
types
kemushi
wide
variety
moth
and
butterfly
caterpillars
throughout
japan
can
cause
great
discomfort
touched
many
have
long
barbed
hairs
with
mild
venom
defense
against
predators
such
birds
and
other
insects
caterpillar
has
long
hair
bright
colors
both
good
rule
thumb
not
touch
can
difficult
remove
all
the
barbed
hairs
from
one
skin
and
the
venom
cause
pain
and
itching
certain
times
year
mainly
spring
various
types
caterpillars
fall
out
trees
the
ground
this
can
sometimes
treacherous
for
hikers
trudging
through
the
woods
have
had
friends
who
have
suddenly
felt
pain
and
realized
caterpillar
fell
down
the
neck
their
shirt
their
shoulder
huntsman
spider
ashidaka
gumo
the
huntsman
gets
its
name
from
its
speed
and
the
way
hunts
they
are
also
sometimes
known
crab
spiders
because
their
size
and
shape
they
tend
prefer
living
woody
places
such
the
forest
woodpiles
and
wooden
shacks
and
buildings
they
also
can
live
under
rocks
and
large
pieces
tree
bark
full
grown
male
spiders
can
have
diameter
legs
inches
about
the
size
dinner
plate
some
people
confuse
them
with
tarantulas
because
their
appearance
the
hunstman
spider
does
have
venom
that
uses
immobilize
its
prey
they
have
been
known
inflict
defensive
bites
that
are
quite
painful
and
lead
swelling
but
their
venom
not
normally
considered
dangerous
healthy
humans
they
are
often
considered
beneficial
since
they
feed
insect
pests
such
cockroaches
there
you
have
not
all
these
are
technically
insects
six
legs
body
parts
abdomen
thorax
and
head
antennae
but
they
fit
into
the
creepy
crawly
zone

television
show
that

what
did
was
choose
short
story

there
are
many
amazing
places
see
and
much
culture
learn
about
taking
challenge
like
this
and
for
good
cause
would
pretty
cool
thing
racing
the
planet
this
race
series
that
sees
runner
doing
stage
races
across
the
world
biggest
deserts
looks
amazing
looks
like
the
adventure
lifetime
some
these
adventures
dreaming
are
more
doable
than
others
racing
the
planet
run
well
the
marathon
des
sables
would
only
take
few
weeks
out
life
some
them
would
involve
months
were
take
adventure
have
few
solid
goals
from
the
get
first
would
choose
charitable
cause
and
fundraise
for
would
use
this
adventure
way
raising
fundraising
profile
next
would
upgrade
camera
equipment
and
film
adventure
would
record
lots
footage
well
thoughts
later
take
all
the
footage
and
turn
into
documentary
style
film
how
the
heck
would
get
the
money
buy
adventure
gear
travel
and
take
part
the
adventure
keep
family
financially
secure
while
was
adventure
and
buy
the
proper
equipment
make
documentary
there
are
basically
two
possibilities
first
could
pursue
sponsorship
could
approach
various
companies
and
ask
them
help
fund
adventure
and
return
give
them
more
exposure
and
advertising
this
might
possibility
since
have
some
decent
social
media
clout
due
youtube
channels
and
friends
within
the
youtube
community
the
second
way
raise
fund
crowd
source
would
come
with
idea
map
out
and
plan
very
detailed
way
would
make
budgets
and
then
start
getting
creative
with
filming
and
editing
would
need
make
pitch
video
and
then
start
kickstarter
maybe
search
for
funding
indiegogo
with
social
media
reach
this
might
possible
way
honestly
would
probably
take
both
approaches
seek
sponsorship
and
the
crowd
source
well
order
make
this
more
appealing
both
companies
and
people
they
will
part
with
some
money
equipment
would
need
make
adventure
exciting
something
people
would
find
cool
something
people
would
really
get
behind
and
excited
about
would
then
have
clearly
show
folks
how
will
bring
them
along
journey
and
let
them
share
once
adventure
complete
need
produce
something
great
short
documentary
and
book
would
ideal
making
sure
people
know
that
they
support
they
get
those
cool
end
products
for
additional
charge
might
make
the
proposition
more
appealing
too
time
get
serious
and
start
planning
adventure

keys
being
able
raise
bilingual

strong
communication
with
your
spouse

good
have
clear
action
plan
and
make
sure
that
you
the
same
page
earlier
post
about
only
speaking
english
home
talked
about
japanese
wife
who
had
anxiety
about
her
husband
only
using
japanese
with
their
kids
the
situation
itself
absolutely
fine
you
have
interest
your
children
learning
english
another
language
and
fine
with
only
one
there
are
issues
all
with
both
parents
speaking
japanese
the
mother
was
feeling
anxiety
though
because
she
wants
her
children
speak
english
well
japanese
the
sounds
the
two
parents
are
definitely
not
the
same
page
have
they
ever
sat
down
and
talked
about
their
children
language
development
have
they
discussed
future
plans
who
knows
but
these
are
things
that
parents
need
talk
about
think
wife
and
have
been
pretty
good
far
with
discussing
our
children
language
learning
after
the
kids
have
gone
bed
night
have
sat
and
talked
about
what
dvds
would
good
for
our
son
which
kindergartens
would
best
and
how
wife
will
use
english
the
house
thought
about
english
kindergartens
well
japanese
kindergartens
for
son
decided
send
him
japanese
kindergarten
next
year
and
are
now
thinking
about
how
will
reinforce
his
english
once
his
japanese
language
development
takes
off
about
year
ago
when
son
japanese
language
skills
really
started
take
off
started
feel
stress
and
anxiety
thought
myself
times
man
wish
was
raising
him
canada
now
although
trained
teacher
and
have
read
lot
about
the
topic
couldn
help
myself
but
get
stressed
know
that
are
japan
course
develop
japanese
first
know
uses
japanese
all
day
long
course
would
his
first
language
said
myself
this
all
problem
said
this
myself
but
still
started
feel
anxiety
when
saw
one
language
developing
more
rapidly
than
the
other
then
talked
wife
about
feelings
she
was
great
she
listened
and
reassured
that
she
would
also
work
hard
make
sure
our
son
learned
much
english
possible
her
reassurance
definitely
made
feel
better
think
that
fact
that
have
been
communicating
our
feelings
about
teaching
our
children
has
helped
reduce
stress
great
deal
think
some
important
questions
spouses
can
ask
each
other
they
are
similar
situation
are
what
language
goals
want
for
our
kids
bilingual
unilingual
trilingual
how
will
help
develop
our
child
second
language
will
solely
responsible
for
the
second
language
development
send
our
child
english
language
preschool
kindergarten
international
school
our
child
goes
international
school
how
will
their
primary
language
develop
how
will
their
understanding
japanese
culture
where
they
live
develop
our
child
goes
english
kindergarten
elsewhere
how
will
they
have
chance
make
local
friends
english
kindergartens
tend
have
very
small
class
sizes
will
child
lose
out
social
opportunities
and
his
her
ability
develop
social
problem
solving
skills
ones
they
would
develop
larger
class
will
get
cable
satellite
television
child
has
english
language
television
watch
will
buy
them
english
language
dvds
which
ones
put
some
serious
thought
into
this
one
easy
choose
dvds
that
have
educational
quality
your
kids
will
have
interest
will
make
home
english
only
environment
the
evenings
forcing
language
someone
may
cause
him
her
resent
will
studying
child
first
language
help
teach
him
his
second
language
probably
yes
since
you
will
know
what
they
are
saying
their
first
language
and
then
you
can
teach
them
how
say
the
same
thing
their
second
language
how
can
make
language
learning
fun
how
and
what
age
will
start
teach
them
read
and
write
speaking
and
listening
comes
easily
compared
these
speaking
and
listening
can
learned
passively
just
being
immersed
the
language
environment
whereas
reading
and
writing
must
actively
taught
and
reinforced
with
much
practice
what
some
point
our
child
refuses
use
his
her
second
language
language
rebellion
there
are
many
other
questions
families
will
find
them
asking
themselves
and
each
other
through
out
their
child
education
communication
within
the
family
key
raising
successful
language
learners
also
important
factor
reducing
any
stress
that
may
arise
the
family
extremely
important
for
parents

son
already
knows
that
english
his
father
language
and
japanese

trying
remedy
that
the
moment
must
communicate

and
vice

within
our

situation
now
even
could

our
day
day
interactions
did
would
robbing
him
his
chance
hear
and
utilize
the
native
english
speaker
living
under
his
own
roof
would
taking
away
his
teacher
live
japan
and
every
time
children
head
out
the
door
japanese
surrounds
them
they
practice
the
language
constantly
and
course
their
first
language
they
don
need
speak
them
understanding
japanese
does
course
help
though
often
son
may
not
know
how
express
himself
english
asks
question
makes
statement
japanese
understand
what
saying
can
model
the
language
for
him
english
speaks
japanese
repeat
what
just
said
english
and
then
make
him
repeat
the
modeling
style
language
teaching
works
extremely
well
and
the
more
japanese
understand
the
better
will
using
this
method
wife
has
told
that
some
japanese
women
she
has
met
who
are
married
foreign
men
such
myself
worry
when
their
husbands
only
speak
japanese
their
kids
pre
school
early
elementary
school
what
known
the
critical
phase
language
acquisition
that
the
time
when
child
can
learn
new
language
with
accent
and
sound
like
native
speaker
least
close
one
mother
shared
her
worries
with
wife
she
said
that
her
kindergarten
aged
children
could
only
speak
japanese
and
was
stressed
because
when
they
travel
america
meet
her
husband
family
the
kids
would
not
have
the
ability
communicate
that
something
think
about
often
live
far
away
from
family
canada
and
someday
plan
return
there
with
family
for
whatever
reason
even
stayed
japan
half
son
family
and
the
majority
relatives
are
canadian
and
don
speak
japanese
when
visit
canada
and
spend
time
with
them
how
will
able
communicate
with
his
grandparents
cousins
aunts
and
uncles

wouldn
able
missing
out
much
suppose
another
thing

him
bad
pronunciation

advantages

raising
bilingual
child
code
switching
code
switching
close
and
personal
have
admit
that
watching
son
language
development
absolutely
amazing
grew
one
language
household
family
used
english
now
family
japan
uses
both
english
the
house
and
outside
well
son
now
newly
minted
year
old
mentioned
before
his
first
language
japanese
and
his
second
language
english
his
speaking
skills
are
quite
high
and
clear
that
can
communicate
much
more
fluently
japanese
but
what
have
noticed
recently
the
dramatic
increase
his
code
switching
skills
linguistics
code
switching
switching
between
two
more
language
varieties
the
context
single
conversation
when
son
was
only
one
year
old
started
conversing
both
english
and
japanese
with
family
and
friends
that
point
didn
realize
that
there
was
difference
between
the
two
languages
was
learning
would
speak
his
little
friends
mixture
english
and
japanese
and
they
would
just
look
him
blankly
their
japanese
skills
were
also
just
emerging
but
course
they
didn
understand
any
english
not
long
after
was
two
years
old
switch
his
brain
was
flipped
and
realized
that
when
was
the
local
kindergarten
community
center
playground
with
his
friends
and
their
mothers
should
only
speak
japanese
the
most
basic
and
obvious
examples
code
switching
with
son
are
the
home
when
interacts
with
his
mother
who
japanese
and
myself
when
come
home
from
wok
the
evening
runs
down
the
hall
yelling
hello
daddy
and
then
commences
tell
about
his
day
adventures
english
when
respond
him
english
runs
back
down
the
hall
and
tells
wife
what
just
said
but
japanese
the
dinner
table
sits
the
end
and
sit
either
side
him
the
majority
his
day
spent
living
japanese
when
come
home
wife
and
speak
english
each
other
and
son
and
now
daughter
haven
set
english
only
rule
our
house
that
some
other
people
just
tend
use
english
because
japanese
skills
are
not
strong
also
even
though
currently
learning
japanese
choose
not
use
around
son
since
his
only
daily
opportunities
hear
natural
english
are
with
our
normal
dinner
experiences
are
english
times
though
son
will
tell
story
english
and
then
immediately
turn
his
mother
and
repeat
the
story
japanese
other
times
will
share
with
her
english
watching
his
code
switching
skills
evolve
constant
and
wonderful

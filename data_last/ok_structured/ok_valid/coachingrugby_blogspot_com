article
and
agree
the
commenters
however
enraged
many
the
comments
were
about
title
one
commenter
called
the
elephant
the
room
asserted
that
title
what
holding
rugby
back
from
becoming
varsity
sport
and
that
even
came
the
table
with
outrageous
amount
money
wouldn
able
start
men
varsity
program
because
title
didn
consider
starting
women
program
with
the
fictitious
outrageous
amount
money
which
prompted
another
commenter
state
thats
exactly
why
need
title
the
thread
then
turned
discussion
ticket
sales
and
the
marketability
women
rugby
with
lots
thumbs
about
women
rugby
not
being
exciting
men
rugby
and
how
somehow
has
something
with
title
which
can
help
but
wonder
has
ever
seen
high
level
women
match
comparing
college
women
the
men
the
rugby
world
cup
but
digress
what
enraged
was
how
much
approval
and
agreement
there
was
about
how
title
problem
while
big
time
college
sports
like
football
and
basketball
have
revenue
component
most
not
has
anyone
ever
heard
wrestling
golf
program
generating
revenue
for
university
because
varsity
sports
not
about
ticket
sales
marketability
entertainment
varsity
sport
programs
exist
for
the
players
who
participate
there
are
volumes
incontrovertible
evidence
that
participating
well
run
structured
competitive
athletic
program
pay
lifetime
benefits
athletes
have
greater
academic
success
use
drugs
less
have
lower

have
higher

going
pay
send
hypothetical
daughter
college
college
thats
accepts
public
funds
the
only
schools
that

applys
then
she
damn
well
better
have
access
the
same
opportunities
hypothetical
son
want
them
both
get
all
the
benefits
and
personal
growth
that
sports
provide
that
why

exists
not
some

unless

reduce

competition
and
why
our
own
worst
enemy
you
have
living
women
rugby
vaccum
have
missed
all
the
upsets
going
this
season
the
wpl
the
surfers
freshly
promoted
the
wpl
are
tearing
things
with
big
road
win
against
and
even
bigger
home
win
against
the
valks
the
amazons
are
looking
fabulous
and
berkley
back
and
again
dominant
with
flo
the
helm
however
there
still
talk
about
how
hard
all
the
traveling
how
much
money
costs
and
speculation
about
how
some
the
top
clubs
would
match
with
the
struggling
wpl
clubs
teams
are
not
going
away
games
full
strength
the
results
last
year
showed
and
the
results
this
year
continue
show
out
rugbymag
com
poster
brought
the
promotion
relegation
policy
being
problematic
think
bigger
than
that
the
goal
the
wpl
was
raise
the
level
competition
for
our
top
rugby
athletes
pulling
the
top
teams
out
and
creating
nationwide
premier
league
the
vision
was
that
blowouts
would
thing
the
past
and
that
each
and
every
game
would
challenging
and
competitive
our
former
wnt
staff
was
very
committed
the
success
the
wpl
and
current
and
prospective
wnt
players
were
pushed
play
the
wpl
several
players
relocated
changed
jobs
left
clubs
they
been
with
for
long
time
get
into
the
wpl
and
play
level
that
would
get
them
the
best
chance
making
the
wnt
what
happened
for
the
most
part
with
some
exceptions
the
same
clubs
continued
dominate
and
finished
the
same
spot
the
world
cup
did
previous
world
cups
our
current
wnt
staff
isn
aggressively
promoting
the
wpl
rather
they
are
directing
players
who
aspire
play
for
the
wnt
overseas
for
experience
result
players
are
moving
back
the
clubs
they
started
with
going
clubs
other
than
the
perennial
big
going
the
better
clubs
for
job
relationship
and
quality
life
reasons
the
result
seeing
traditional
teams
are
being
upset
due
lack
personel
and
new
leaders
are
rising
will
this
good
bad
for
our
top
level
competition
only
time
will
tell
personally
don
think
the
wpl
overseas
play
the
answer
improving
out
quality
competition
think
need
redefine
our
club
experience
currently
there
not
alot
internal
competition
the
club
level
what
mean
there
are
very
few
clubs
where
each
and
every
practice
our
best
players
are
competitng
for
positional
and
game
time
when
cipp
rolls
are
less
than
you
can
bet
you
see
the
same
faces
week
after
week
the
pitch
clubs
are
defined
the
division
they
play
rather
than
the
development
they
provide
beantown
wpl
atlanta
the
atomic

are
you
got

you
putting
out

whenever
you
can
imho
this
flaw
thinking
and
flaw
our
development
model
order
for
grow
the
top
athletes
into
top
rugby
players
they
need
compete
every
week
practice
and
games
can
that
continue

thin
for
the
become

superpower
and
for

somewhere
that

and
perhaps
the
most
potent

obviously
couldn
this
smaller

but
when
the
last
time
you
heard
about
the
nfl
mlb
team
norman
allentown
fort
collins
what
talking
about
having
set
truly
premier
organizations
that
are
defined
the
overall
strength
the
organization
rather
than
the
strength
handful
individual
players
these
organizations
could
become
massive
powerhouses
with
wpl
and
sides
maybe
even
and
old
girls
side
coaching
staffs
would
grow
leaps
and
bounds
and
director
rugby
could
provide
coach
development
structure
improve
the
skills
subordinate
coaches
and
provide
mentorship
all
especially
entry
level
coaches
each
program
could
have
positional
and
skill
specific
coaches
shared
across
multiple
sides
and
response
our
biggest
challenge
money
have
more
dues
paying
members
more
resources
leverage
for
fundraising
and
sponsorship
and
more
appeal
sponsors
our
top
sides
would
able
travel
strong
yes
this
the
commonwealth
model
don
think
should
things
like
england
because
are
different
many
ways
but
not
just
england
that
uses
this
model
the
whole
world
except
team
rivalries
and
individual
reluctance
for
positional
competition
the
club
level
are
what
holds
back
myself
was
that
thought
trap
for

what

let
the

throw
and
see
where
the

goes
then
troubleshoot
but
resist
the
urge
simply
make
them
the
way
you
did
when
you
played
the

how

how

points
for
observation
flight
the

wobbling
does
have
tight
spiral
which
helps
with
distance
and
speed
but
really
isn
all
that
important
when
starting

the
follow
through
off
the
throw
will
off
like
tell
handed
throwers
take
picture
their
target
with
every
throw
focus
the
follow
through
for
one
handed
throwers
their
delivery
hand
should
perfectly
aligned
the
target
after
every
throw
there
lots
talk
about
weighting
the
hands
etc
but
find
that
those
problems
can
fixed
with
proper
focus
the
follow
through
even
the
ball
tumbles
wildly
when
the
throwers
hips
are
aligned
the
tunnel
and
when
the
thrower
has
perfect
follow
through
ball
delivery
the
ball
will
straight
distancenow
that
have
straight
throw
whats
next
does
have
the
power
carry
the
target
not
take
look
the
thrower
and
see
you
can
tell
where
they
are
generating
power
from
are
their
arms
bend
deeply
behind
the
neck
indicating
that
power
generated
through
the
triceps
are
the
leaning
way
back
pre
throw
indicating
that
power
generated
through
the
core
the
player
taking
step
forward
indicating
power
through
the
hips
and
legs
there
big
wrist
snap
once
you
know
where
player
generating
power
you
can
make
work
through
techniques
generate
more
power
focus
using
the
largest
muscles
hips
legs
core
for
maximum
power
generation
let
the
player
work
their
throw
while
lying
flat
the
grown
let
them
explore
power
generation
from
the
core
and
from
kneeling
position
add
the
hips
the
equation
the
player
really
needs
more
add
step
but
whatever
you
this
phase
don
loose
sight
the
first
phase
straight
trajectory
arc
order
successful
thrower
the
ball
must
not
only
fly
straight
and
true
but
must
have
enough
arc
clear
defensive
jumpers
can
attack
quickly
off
the
back
the
trajectory
the
ball
directly
related
the
release
point
that
the
point
the
throw
where
the
thrower
actually
lets
the
ball
since
want
the
ball
clear
jumper
and
then
drop
our
jumper
the
highest
point
the
are
actually
going
front
our
target
first
off
our
thrower
need
visualize
the
path
the
ball
and
then
use
the
peak
the
arc
his
her
target
and
the
point
where
she
directs
the
follow
through
sounds
difficult
maybe
maybe
not
your
player
has
trouble
clearing
defensive
jumpers
dropping
the
ball
target
let
them
spend
some
time
throwing
over
the
goalpost
like
set
tire
underneath
and
about
meter
behind
the
goal
post
and
ask
the
thrower
put
the
ball
the
tire
with
repetition
they
will
learn
specifically
how
they
need
adjust
their
release
point
most
often
without
any
input
from
the
player
gets
the
concept
you
can
start
throwing
over
jumping
pods
the
player
will
learn
that
order
put
and
appropriate
arc
the
ball
she
needs
release
earlier
goes
addition
forward
distance
againas
this
point
many
players
especially
younger
players
will
begin
struggle
why
well
when
your
throwing
those
big
lobs
much
the
distance
eaten
height
that
arc
longer
than
straight
line
really
good
throwing
the
back
the
player
must
work
trajectory
well
distance
this
great
time
revisit
power
generation
and
remind
players
how
generate
power
through
their
big
muscles
specifically
their
core
like
for
players
work
the
crunch
throw
this
point
let
the
player
lie
the
ground
with
knees
bent
and
feet
firmly
planted
the
ground
let
then
then
throw
standing
partner
important
that
the
throw
happen
the
player
crunches
the
top
not
after
and
that
the
learning
inforced
that
power
comes
from
the
core
not
from
the
arms
speedspeed
really
the
finishing
touch
adding
the
speed
component
enhances
everything
the
ball
flies
truer
further
and
obviously
faster
this
the
spiral
there
are
many
thoughts
how
get
the
magic
spiral
that
carries
with
the
gift
speed
here
are
thoughts
different
for
everyone
personal
technique
for
generating
spiral
simply
use
finger
put
little
english
the
ball
leaves
hand
when
work
with
players
though
don
assume
that
they
will
throwing
exactly
the
way
experiment
like
have
each
player
grab
ball
and
genty
toss
over
head
with
the
goal
making
spin
they
can
with
thumb
forefinger
with
the
throw
hand
with
the
guide
hand
the
player
throwing
one
handed
she
can
roll
the
fingers
off
the
ball
leaves
the
hand
just
throwing
football
spiral
which
lets
face
americans
players
can
throw
football
spirals
whatever
method
your
players
use
spin
the
ball
the
key
now
make
sure
they
throw
the
same
way
every
single
time
the
bottom
line
you
can
shoot
one
bulls
eye
you
can
shoot
long
you
the
same
way
every
time
since
the
spiral
intimately
tied
hand
position
good
way
remind
players
their
key
factors
simply
have
them
through
pre
check
every
lineout
feet
hips
hands
feet
and
hips
are

the

tuesday
december
the
advanced
coaching
course
better
late
than
never
the
final
weekend
the
advanced
coaching
course
wound
this
fall
and
regret
been
remiss
blogging
here
was
tough
bottom
line
the
course
completed
serves
professionalize
your
approach
coaching
while
the
early
training
sessions
did
some
practical
coaching
modules
became
clear
that
the
purpose
those
modules
was
ensure
that
participating
coaches
understand
and
into
the
notion
coaching
across
continuum
and
that
the
coaches
are
board
with
using
player
centered
coaching
methods
once
that
gate
passed
the
emphasis
the
course
shifts
game
analysis
player
and
team
profiling
year
long
periodization
cycles
and
technical
growth
was
tough
can
say
that
again
first
off
was
the
only
coach
attendance
who
was
not
currently
super
league
national
team
coach
got
very
lucky
getting
into
the
program
and
was
able
through
role
course
leader
participating
the
elite
coaching
course
and
via
stalking
nigel
melville
essentially
someone
dropped
out
the
course
and
was
the
right
place
literally
the
right
time
and
was
able
fill
the
seat
last
minute
the
very
first
session
was
bit
intimidating
did
game
analysis
and
practical
coaching
coached
players
and
our
peers
everything
and
mean
everything
did
presented
our
peers
the
facilitors
and
the
instructors
now
peers
mean
super
league
and
national
team
coaches
admittedly
took
little
while
get
over
the
sticker
shock
coaching
some
the
most
well
known
names
the
american
game
but
thanks
the
facilitators
and
mentors
all
very
senior
irb
and
usa
folks
the
shock
didn
last
too
long
and
was
able
move
whew
there
was
significant
amount
attrition
the
course
which
lasted
for
year
and
included
face
face
workshops
and
about
zillion
deliverables
recently
the
announcement
went
out
for
applicants
for
the
cycle
and
here
recommendation
anyone
thinking
about
you
aspire
run
your
team
and
your
own
coaching
practice
professional
you
are
get
feather
your
cap
stamp
your
resume
just
rub
shoulders
with
the
various
guest
coaches
and
the
attendees
don
the
shoulder
rubbing
part
certainly
one
the
best
parts
the
course
but
imho
that
privilege
should
reserved
for
the
few
coaches
who
really
want
bring
their
entire
coaching
practice
the
next
level
not
just
their
technical
knowledge
the
technical
knowledge
were
exposed
from
both
guest
coaches
and
from
each
other
was
tremendous
but
without
the
analysis
profiling
and
planning
pieces
really
doesn
carry
the
same
bang
anyone
got
any
questions
about
the
course
thinking
about
doing
etc
please
don
shy
about
asking
you
were
participant
don
shy
about
commenting
personally
thought
was
fabulous
experience
and
still
processing
everything
came
away
with
but
was
hard
was
challenging
thought
provoking
and
time
consuming
and
really
forced
you
examine
how
you
things
whether
your
serving
your
team
and
your
players
the
best
your
abilities
and
more
than
anything
reminded
how
much
all
still
have
learn
hopefully
are
creating
community
coaches
who
all
want
move
the
practice
forward
and
even
more
hopefully
the
next
class
coaches
will
continue
and
push
the
envelope

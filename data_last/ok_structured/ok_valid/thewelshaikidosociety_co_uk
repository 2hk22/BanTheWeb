sensei
saunders
adventure
with
aikido
began
the
early
when
the
senior
grade
the
rhondda
that
time
was
kyu
later
local
adult
education
centre
sensei
saunders
was
taught
dan
grade
who
came
from
cardiff
hywel
jenkins
result
some
the
class
attended
summer
school
given
sensei
williams
sensei
williams
saw
the
strength
commitment
rhondda
and
eventually
set
his
own
dojo
there
built
strong
organisation
eventually
containing
many
dan
grades
excellent
calibre
testament
the
quality
his
teaching
when
sensei
williams
placed
himself
with
master
koichi
tohei
those
who
stayed
with
him
had
the
advantage
completely
new
approach
aikido
the
resulting
change
emphasis
was
not
everyone
taste
but
for
the
first
time
sensei
saunders
began
understand
what
had
been
striving
for
both
sensei
williams
unequivocal
support
for
aikido
and
sensei
saunders
first
hand
contact
with
master
tohei
the
late
made
him
realise
the
way
that
has
followed
ever
since
sadly
schisms
abound
aikido
despite
the
high
ideals
the
founder
and
the
late
sensei
saunders
found
himself
the
head
what
was
become
the
welsh
aikido
society
had
never
been
his
intention
the
head
anything
other
than
his
business
interests
the
quotation
regarding
those
who
have
greatness
thrust
upon
them
particularly
appropriate
his
case
however
sensei
saunders
continues
develop
his
own
aikido
and
gain
great
satisfaction
from
seeing
the
advances
his
own
students
testimonials
what
our
students
say
about
good

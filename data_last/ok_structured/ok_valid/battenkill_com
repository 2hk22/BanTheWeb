carries
new
places
explore
different
cultures
showcases
for
human
creativity

nature
boundless
garden

there
more
travel

other
cultures
without
prejudice
walk
the
sun
and
enjoy
and
rock
the
cradle
life
traveling
canoe

the
roads
allows
experience
life
through
different
eyes
and
perhaps
our
greatest
duty
outfitters

become
involved

our
host
mother
earth
and
assist
nature
rebuilding
her
exquisite
beauty

the
healing
process
requires
that
her
garden
life
kept
glorious
bedlam
not
paved
and
bottled

cut

pruned
but
growing
sweet
disorder

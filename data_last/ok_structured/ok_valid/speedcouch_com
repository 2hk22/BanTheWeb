mccumbee
always
had
interest
the
series
for
years
now
when
found
out
the
series
was
coming
back
myrtle
beach
obviously
that
place
very
special
and
any
time
there
any
type
special
event
there
look
see
maybe
could
put
something
together
done
some
work
with
those
guys
over
and
with
cal
boprey
and
bryan
silas
and
those

car
that
they
run
few
races
this
year
and
just
got
talking
about
and
made
work
there
enjoyed
and
maybe
got
some
more
coming
speedcouch
you
said
myrtle

was
special
you
that
where

your
start
late
models
mccumbee
yeah
sure
was
that
where
ran
late
model
stocks
back
when
first
moved
that
division
always
been
place
that
try
anything
can
help
myrtle
beach
and
anything
can
participate
races
they
have
always
try
speedcouch
can
you
talk
little
bit
about
the
pro
cup
car
the
tires
the
engine
package
compared
the
other
series
you
race
mccumbee
been
running
the
arca
series
this
year
and
was
very
similar
the
bfgoodrich
tire
was
more
like
true
radial
would
say
than
the
tire
that
run
short
track
the
arca
cars
the
hoosier
that
run
arca
cars
radial
but
short
track
radial
there
similar
feel
there
obviously
the
cars
weigh
about
the
same
and
the
motor
package
real
similar
think
the
option
motor
packages
that
you
can
run
the
pro
cup
series
now
great
because
that
allows
bunch
different
competitors
able
easily
get
into
the
series
they
don
have
have
certain
type
motor
you
know
even
with
the
cars
feel
like
specific
pro
cup
car
better
but
think
you
can
still
compete
with
old
nationwide
car
even

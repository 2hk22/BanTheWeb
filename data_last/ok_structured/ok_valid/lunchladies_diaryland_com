hello
darlings
its
just
pimmi
the
moment
have
been
quite
adventure
was
meant
simple
trip
visit
friend
and
transport
some
spiders
back
mirkwood
but
its
become
quite
big
soiree
are
now
our
way
back
mordor
getting
ready
leave
nightfall
lessen
the
crowds
yes
said
crowds
have
become
quite
the
celebrities
here
people
have
never
seen
orcish
folk
before
except
maybe
chopped
burned
and
dead
battlefields
the
mirkwood
diner
has
become
veritable
hotspot
for
taking
gander
little
lunch
ladies
tempted
say
think
they
never
seen
orc
before
but
its
true
all
began
simply
when
decided
fix
the
floors
after
the
mordor
community
theater
burnt
quite
lot
the
cafeteria
flooring
trying
create
comedy
about
the
berserker
who
tries
wrestle
balrog
and
they
fall
love
wait
that
doesn
sound
right
well
was
something
like
that
after
the
floors
were
burned
many
places
and
had
peel
scared
gobbies
out
the
rafters
there
saw
had
fix
the
floors
they
looked
awful
some
hobbits
visiting
that
flowerbottom
introduced
were
specialists
this
field
and
took
the
job
one
day
soon
after
they
began
they
reached
the
absolute
bottom
under
the
floor
and
that
was
the
day
they
ran
screaming
from
the
cafeteria
don
think
anyone
will
forget
that
the
hobbits
thought
were
under
attack
and
humans
and
remaining
elves
still
don
know
what
call
those
folks
suppose
they
really
are
still
elves
well
everybody
came
and
watched
very
largish
spiders
came
crawling
out
they
sat
there
still
with
many
eyes
glittering
and
everyone
stared
each
other
for
long
time
one
moving
until
said
how
about
bit
lunch
for
everyone
well
some
the
humans
thought
had
just
offered
them
for
snack
the
spiders
and
there
was
all
kinds
hand
and
sword
waving
and
yelling
and
making
big
and
the
spiders
sat
there
silent
watching
until
the
folks
calmed
down
and
looked
the
spiders
again
pati
says
are
you
going
try
and
eat
everybody
what
and
everyone
shock
the
biggest
spider
answered
sweet
singsong
voice
why
were
waiting
for
appropriate
time
properly
introduce
ourselves
well
think
some
the
human
ladies
present
fainted
everyone
afterward
spoke
for
long
while
they
were
descended
from
mirkwood
clans
and
wished
reunited
they
had
never
agreed
with
the
evil
spider
practises
the
mordor
clans
and
now
that
all
that
fuss
was
over
could
someone
please
point
them
the
path
mirkwood
you
can
see
they
had
learned
their
speech
from
listening
under
the
floor
boards
there
and
had
had
enough
with
evil
and
things
and
even
though
was
all
over
they
wanted
see
the
old
country
again
but
course
they
couldn
just
path
they
would
never
make
was
decided
transport
them
back
wagon
one
day
anyone
would
take
them
seemed
like
the
right
thing
the
cafeteria
was
closed
for
repair
wanted
visit
our
friend
mirkwood
was
all
aranged
simple
thought
veritable
wagon
town
was
what
left
mordor
that
day
big
line
caravans
making
their
way
back
distant
places
was
all
very
dramatic
pati
and
were
train
wagons
covered
with
the
entire
mirkwood
clan
spiders
its
storage
areas
they
had
spell
cast
over
them
sleep
the
whole
way
and
were
told
not
tell
anyone
what
had
the
spiders
people
might
panic
course
that
didn
work
out
somehow
all
along
the
way
people
knew
what
had
and
begged
for
looks
and
that
course
woke
them
did
you
know
that
spiders
are
incessant
chatter
boxes
and
always
the
same
topics
webs
how
arrrange
and
clean
the
sticky
and
decorate
the
non
sticky
threads
and
the
best
way
eat
the
maggots
the
flies
their
favorite
part
how
serve
them
how
pop
them
open
eat
them
one
time
all
once
just
suck
them
out
taking
off
the
non
juicy
parts
bugs
first
not
then
after
they
are
done
they
seem
forget
they
already
discussed
this
then
goes
round
again
slightly
differently
worded
but
always
the
same
thing
they
made
sick
had
stop
over
and
over
while
one
scampered
out
and
collected
insects
for
them
eat
hoped
dearly
for
another
wizardly
type
come
along
and
put
them
back
under
but
such
luck
webs
maggots
bugs
webs
maggots
bugs
webs
maggots
bugs
then
bugs
maggots
webs
bugs
maggots
webs
arrg
they
were
pleasant
creatures
don
get
wrong
but
one
would
think
that
something
frightening
looking
would
least
smidgen
interesting
some
towns
would
stop
and
demand
take
oaths
some
sort
another
that
were
longer
evil
and
wouldn
eat
anyone
pillage
anyone
house
took
oaths
all
kinds
pati
might
married
one
fellow
aren
sure
none
really
matters
long
everyone
stayed
happy
and
peaceful
children
would
come
throngs
point
and
stare
and
their
mommies
would
look
dark
ways
until
call
out
love
collect
some
tasty
meat
pie
recipes
you
don
mind
any
specialty
you
might
proud
that
seemed
cal
friendly
action
thing
but
then
get
tomes
recipes
that
were
name
after
the
ladies
who
made
them
she
could
brag
she
was
being
eaten
mordor
well
something
like
that
many
new
recipes
human
children
screamed
and
screamed
when
the
spiders
would
pop
their
many
eyed
heads
out
but
then
the
childrens
were
screaming
and
smiling
the
same
time
and
trying
pet
them
not
sure
what
they
were
thinking
they
loved
scream
those
wee
ones
the
spiders
were
egging
them
too
believe
naughty
things
they
wave
their
legs
the
air
and
get
screams
and
laughter
show
fangs
and
the
same
effect
very
funny
that
what
was
like
the
entire
time
stop
and
start
stop
and
start
felt
like
men
would
challenge
our
fellow
orcish
travelers
arm
wrestling
matches
which
think
every
orc
let
the
man
win
because
then
pat
their
back
and
laugh
and
brag
and
buy
them
drinks
and
apologize
for
being
the
stronger
man
orc
won
the
man
would
get
angry
and
break
things
and
wouldn
stop
fussing
until
they
had
another
match
won
one
point
eagle
swooped
down
over
eyeing
everyone
waved
met
him
once
when
mount
doom
blew

when
knew

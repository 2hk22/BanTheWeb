the
battle
for

player
rages
between
nick
green
chris
woodward
and
morgan
ensberg
green
drifter
who
has
played
for
atlanta
tampa
bay
new
york
remember
his
home
run
against
the
mets
july
and
seattle
his
career
stats
are
borderline
embarrassing
even
for
utility
guy
woodward
has
also
drifted
around
from
team
team
playing
for
the
blue
jays
braves
and
mets
over
the
last
years
hit
whopping
home
runs
backing
but
hasn
really
swung
the
bat
well
since
leaving
toronto
morgan
ensberg
has
had
the
most
impressive
career
all
three
our
candidates
hit
home
runs
home
runs
and
home
runs
his
highest
career
batting
average
back
but
only
hit
and
drove
pitiful
home
runs
last
year
the
yankees
picked
ensberg
during
the
offseason
and
hitting
coach
dave
eiland
has
helped
ensberg
reform
his
swing
ensberg
healthy
and
has
been
hitting
beautifully
spring
training
far
this
year
the
yankees
have
already
placed
ensberg
the
man
roster
almost
sure
sign
that
has
made
the
team
and
yes
choice
too
winner
morgan
ensberg
lefty
reliever
the
firm
belief
that
every
successful
team
should
have
least
one
lefty
reliever
hope
girardi
agrees
with
unfortunately
the
yankees
have
slim
pickings
when
comes
lefty
reliever
here
are
the
nominees
kei
igawa
billy
traber
and
heath
phillips
love
tell
you
igawa
has
miraculously
repaired
his
mechanics
and
pitching
beautifully
and
that
the
yankees
did
not
waste
their
million
dollars
but
that
would
lie
thought
had
seen
the
worst
igawa
but
here
spring
training
outdone
himself
igawa
started
the
spring
giving
grand
slam
some
unknown
college
player
and
then
his
second
outing
walked
the
bases
loaded
since
then
been
giving
away
runs
faster
then
can
count
them
billy
traber
meanwhile
has
come
out
nowhere
and
out
pitched
the
two
leading
candidates
for
the
job
traber
former
indian
and
national
has
gorgeous
and
has
struck
out
boatload
lefties
heath
phillips
probably
the
most
talented
the
three
pitchers
this
contest
but
has
looked
awful
this
spring
not
only
has
given
ton
hits
and
has
bloated
era
but
has
also
been
ineffective
against
lefties
now
what
the
good
lefty
reliever
can
get
lefties
out
remember
mike
myers
winner
billy
traber
long
man
spot
starter
yet
another
exciting
battle
between
yankee
players
lies
the
race
for
the
long
man
position
the
competitors
are
heath
phillips
kei
igawa
darrell
rasner
and
jeff
karstens
the
first
two
ruled
out
earlier
one
not
ready
for
the
majors
yet
the
other
will
never
the
battle
has
been
whittled
down
rasner
karstens
jeff
karstens
this
spring
with
era
opponents
bat
whopping
against
him
and
only
struck
out
men
darrell
rasner
meanwhile
with
era
and
strikout
walk
ratio
hmmm
neither
has
been
very
good
let
check
out
some
career
stats
karstens
made
his
major
league
debut
with
the
yankees
and
since
then
has
made
starts
with
era
still
remember
his
contribution
the
season
stepping
and
pitching
well
saving
the
team
from
utter
collapse
like
see
him
the
team
darrell
rasner
made
his
major
league
debut
for
washington
and
was
traded
the
yankees
made
career
starts
and
with
era
the
numbers
slightly
point
rasner
but
for
some
reason
prefer
karstens
the
team
maybe
his
starts
the
fact
that
the
red
sox
broke
his
leg
but
like
karstens
actually
got
decent
stuff
and
bit
more
dominant
then
rasner
think
stays
healthy
able
contribute
this
year
winner
jeff
karstens
righty
reliever
final
spot
the
bullpen
this
final
spot
the
most
tightly
contested
spot
the
yankees
roster
meet
the
candidates
brian
bruney
chris
britton
ross
ohlendorf
and
scott
patterson
here
brian
bruney
big
and
mean
big
righty
hurler
that
often
has
trouble
finding
the
strike
zone
bruney
made
his
major
league
debut
for
arizona
and
came
over
new
york
his
career
numbers
aren
pretty
era
and
that
waaaay
too
many
walks
girardi
likes
seeing
strikes
won
like
seeing
bruney
the
mound
chris
britton
pitched
for
the
orioles
and
the
yankees
his
career
numbers
are
decent
era
and
ross
ohlendorf
pitched
games
spetmember
for
the
yankees
those
games
pitched
innings
and
had
era
with
strikouts
and
only
walks
very
nice
scott
patterson
year
old
righty
with
career
minor
league
record
with
era
the
oldest
our
nominations
but
also
the
only
one
without
major
league
experience
the
career
numbers
really
don
tell
enough
let
check
out
their
spring
stats
bruney
has
pitched
games
and
holds
era
with
and
come
into
camp
great
shape
lost
lot
weight
throwing
hard
mph
and
throwing
strikes
chris
britton
has
pitched
games
and
has
beautiful
era
with
and
ross
ohlendorf
with
era
has
struck
out
while
walking
only
and
finally
scott
patterson
has
save
era
strikouts
and
walks
wow
each
player
has
performed
very
well
this
spring
this
gonna
very
very
difficult
choice
for
girardi
scott
patterson
has
been
the
most
dominant
all
the
candidates
but
only
pitched
innings
and
has
major
league
experience
time
make
decision
thrown
his
pitches
for
strikes
has
really
good
stuff
and
may
finally
give
something
return

against

guess
torre
went
with

over

from

hole
andy

against

the

lefty
hasn

manny

much
fact
trade
yankee
win

innings
from
our

for

win
via
innings
from

think
that
the

jump

for

with

the
new

yankees
launched
one
the
most
awesome

ever
seen
they
beat

closer
joe

and
yes
was
alex

who
delivered
the
death
blow

kathy

but
first
quick
recap
the
previous
eight
innings
the
ballgame
darrell
rasner
pitched
innings
pitches
allowing
one
run
hits
mike
myers
and
brian
bruney
survived
the
skin
their
teeth
the
next
two
innings
the
yanks
took
lead
the
sixth
monstrous
giambi
home
run
but
luis
vizcaino
served
juicy
one
victor
martinez
and
the
injuns
were
farnsworth
and
henn
handled
the
eighth
and
ninth
innings
respectively
allowing
only
one
unearned
run
joe
borowski
came
out
and
retired
robinson
cano
and
melky
cabrera
total
ten
pitches
then
the
fun
began

let
tell
you
thought
this
ballgame
was
over
back
the
eighth
and
with
two
outs
the
ninth
was
not
very
confident
our
chances
winning
but
ain
over
till
over
now
alex
was
hero
tonight
doubt
but
shouldn
forget
the
tremendous
bats
phelps
posada
damon
especially
jeter
and
abreu
one
these
guys
had
failed
rod
would
never
have
come
hit
the
yanks
head
fenway
high
note
back
monday
had
some
big
fears
for
this
six
game
stretch
but
the
yanks
are
off
fine
start
rod
continues
hit
like
has
been
the
yanks
will
take

rasner
takes
the

for
new
york
his
second
start
the
year
let
hope
this
performance
nothing
like
his
last
one
the
lineup
probably
the
weakest
the
american
league
even
rasner
has
shot
brilliance
tonight
man
the
bottom
third
the
yankee
lineup
really
really
weak
matsui
out
posada
has
the
day
off
and
because
his
terrible
production
late
mientkiewicz
sitting
the
bench
joe
blanton
has
only
faced
the
yankees
twice
his
career
and
with
inflated
era
jeter
and
rod
have
each
taken
him
deep
and
phelps
has
driven
three
runs
two
bats
against
the
oakland
pitcher
was
raining
earlier
but
things
have
brightened
and
the
forcast
clear
with
win
tonight
the
yanks
will
back
which
exactly
where
they
were
one

well
the
score
really
says
all
rod
continued
his
mutilation
pitches
over
the
plate
last
night
and
after
launching
his
sixth
homer
the
season
was
intentionally
walked
for
the
first
time
this
year
alex
keeps
hitting
the
way
has
lately
gonna
see
lot
more
that
johnny
also
had
homer
his
first
the
year
and
with
came
his

few
rbi
melky
cabrera
finally
snapped
out
his
slump
and
went
with
out
rbi
single
the
second

but
obviously
the
story
the
night
was
andy

who
delivered
six
innings
pitches
scoreless
baseball
the
yankee
lefty
allowed
only
four
hits
one
walk
and
his
second
start
the
season
the
yanks
face
ramon
ortiz
tonight
they
for
the
sweep
mussina
the

for
the

and
hoping
make
three
consecutive
stellar
starts
for
the

andy

with

andy

pitched
poorly
his

that
feels
much
better
now
then
did
thursday
pettitte
has
pitched
games
against
the

has
